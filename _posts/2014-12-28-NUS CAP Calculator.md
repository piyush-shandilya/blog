Here is a CAP calculator I made in excel. Just a simple excel sheet that helps to keep track of your grades. Feedback welcome and updates will be made to add other functions.

Click here to download <a href="assets/cap-calculator1.xlsx">CAP Calculator v1.0</a>.

Update! : V1.1: <a href="assets/cap-calculator2.xlsx">CAP Calculator v1.1</a>

(Note: this was done to be just used as a guide. Check with faculty for degree requirements and the NUS FASS calculator if necessary).

Inspired from <a title="Agagooga's CAP Calculator" href="http://gssq.entori.net/files/capcalc.htm" target="_blank">Agagooga's CAP calculator</a>.

A better CAP calculator with better user interface is coming, for the web, desktop and mobile platforms. Stay tuned! :)

Cheers.
