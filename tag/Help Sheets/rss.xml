	     <p>Both MA1505 and MA1506 are common modules undertaken by a vast majority of engineering students. They are not exactly easy, and so I thought I will post the helpsheets I have made for my examinations here in the hope that some of the students may find it useful when doing their own helpsheets.</p>

<p>Do note that it is crucial for students to make their own helpsheets as printed or photocopied helpsheets are strictly not allowed. And from experience, it always helps to make your own helpsheet as it comes in as a form of revision.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />
