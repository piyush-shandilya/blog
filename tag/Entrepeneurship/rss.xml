	     <p>Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.</p>

<p>The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.</p>

<h3 id="several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as">Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.</li>
  <li>Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.</li>
  <li>Think big, and expand big.</li>
  <li>Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.</li>
  <li>Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).</li>
  <li>With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru">Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:</h3>
<p>The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!</p>

<p>Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.</li>
  <li>Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.</li>
  <li>Size and Valuation</li>
  <li>Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.</li>
  <li>Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.</li>
  <li>A good M&amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.</li>
</ul>

<p>A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble</p>

<p>Some great quotes I found during the presentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”</p>

  <p>“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz">The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:</h3>

<p>Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.</li>
  <li>Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.</li>
  <li>For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.</li>
  <li>Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.</li>
  <li>Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.</li>
  <li>Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.</li>
  <li>Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.</li>
  <li>Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.</li>
  <li>Maximise existing resources to create value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”</p>

  <p>“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”</p>

  <p>“Instead of finding places where there is already competition, find niche areas where you can dominate the business”</p>

  <p>“See opportunities in problems”</p>

  <p>“Get a MVP, or beta model and launch it. Only then you will receive feedback on what the market wants.”</p>

  <p>“Only the paranoid survives” – Quoted from Andrew Grove, Co-Founder of Intel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, a very fruitful session that stirred up the entrepreneur within me. The world needs change, and only innovation can drive that change. And entrepreneurs can lead that innovation. In that regard, I am motivated to become an entrepreneur myself to help make positive difference in the world.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />
Harish</p>
