Hey there! I am currently a student pursuing my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering. I really like experimenting with new ideas and coding. I host many of my mini-projects on Github. Feel free to adapt them if you need it (an attribution and link back to my blog will be greatly appreciated).

I am experienced with front-end web development, coding in languages such as C, Java, Javascript etc. So if you're looking for a web-designer (Wordpress, Bootstrap, Jekyll frameworks) or a coder, feel free to leave a quote here via the contact form below.
