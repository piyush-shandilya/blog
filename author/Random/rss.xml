	     <p>C’mon, I know you do!</p>

<p>Admit it! You have probably sung in the shower at least once or twice in your life. This so-called phenomenon is know as “Bathroom singing”. It is interesting why many of us love the shower time and particularly why we end up singing during those few minutes of lathering up and showering.</p>

<p>Intriguing as it sounds, I went to check out the scientific reasons behind this.</p>

<h3 id="showering-makes-us-relaxed">Showering makes us relaxed</h3>

<p>Showering helps us relax ourselves. The calm sound of your shower running and the soothing flow of water against your skin helps you to relax yourself. When singing, we often take deep breaths to accomodate the “heavy” parts of the song. These deep breaths in turn help to increase our oxygen flow to the brain. That means further relaxation!</p>

<h3 id="extra-dopamine">Extra dopamine</h3>

<p>As we relax in the shower, the brain starts secreting the pleasure hormone called <a href="http://www.news-medical.net/health/Dopamine-Functions.aspx">dopamine</a>. Dopamine, in turn, helps us with even more creative rendering of songs. No wonder you sound so good!</p>

<h3 id="amazing-acoustics">Amazing acoustics</h3>

<p>Showers are usually quite small and the surrounding four walls make a great room for the acoustics of singing. The reverbs and bounce of your voice off the walls makes singing all the better! These sound “effects” helps us hear ourselves and the intricacies of the song clearly, making it sound great at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="lone-time--extra-confidence">Lone time = Extra Confidence</h3>

<p>I bet many of you would have seen people who would shy away from singing in the public, yet morph into an <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Elvis_Presley">Elvis Presley</a> in their home showers. After a long day of work or study, showering is the probably the only time which allows us to have some “alone” time. And this great because you don’t have to shy away from anyone, you don’t have to worry about what others would think about your ~~horrible~~ singing. It gives you the time to be who you are and do what you like for that tiny bit of 5-10 minutes!</p>

<hr />

<p>Bathrooms seem to have been built for singing. They are awesome avenues to express yourself without worrying about anything else and indeed a great way to bust stress. In fact, <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa15/2015/10/21/why-do-we-sing-in-the-shower/comment-page-1/">studies show</a> that people who consistently sing in the shower benefit from many positive effects.</p>

<p>Keep singing! Who knows? - The next <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Ed_Sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> might be born out of the shower! 😂</p>

	  <title>I Have a Dream</title>
	  <link>/blog//i-have-a-dream</link>
	  <author>Harish V</author>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I am sharing one of the most inspiring speeches in human history - ‘I have a dream’, by Martin Luther King Jr. Even today when I read or watch this, I am truly inspired by the passion Martin Luther King Jr. shows when he speaks every single word with conviction. What an amazing leader!</p>

<hr />

<p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.</p>

<p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p>

<p>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.</p>

<p>In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”</p>

<p>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p>

<p>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.</p>

<p>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p>

<p>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.</p>

<p>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.</p>

<p>We cannot walk alone.</p>

<p>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.</p>

<p>We cannot turn back.</p>

<p>There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”</p>

<p>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.</p>

<p>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.</p>

<p>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</p>

<p>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>dream</strong> today!</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”</p>

<p>This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.</p>

<p>With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</p>

<p>And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.</p>

  <p>Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,</p>

  <p>From every mountainside, let freedom ring!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.</p>

<p>And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not only that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.</p>

  <p>Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.</p>

  <p>From every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:</p>

<p><em>Free at last! Free at last!</em></p>

<p><em>Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em></p>

<p>By <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong></p>

<p>An American pastor, activist, humanitarian. People know him for leading the African-American Civil Rights movement using nonviolent civil disobedience.</p>

	  <title>Solving Einstein's Riddle</title>
	  <link>/blog//Solving-Einstein's-Riddle</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IgXHPOF.jpg " alt="Einstein" style="width: 200px;" /></p>

<p>There is an interesting riddle written by Einstein in the last century. He claimed that <strong>98%</strong> of the people in the world will not be able to solve it.</p>

<h2 id="the-riddle">The Riddle:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are 5 different houses, each of a different colour.</li>
  <li>There is a owner of a different nationality in each house.</li>
  <li>Each of the owner drinks a specific type of drink.</li>
  <li>Each of the house owner smokes a specific type of cigarettes.</li>
  <li>Each of the house owner has a specific type of pet.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>None of the owners drink the same drink / smoke the same cigarette brand / have the same type of pets / have same nationality / live in the same house.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-clues">The Clues:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the Brit lives in the red house</li>
  <li>the Swede keeps dogs as pets</li>
  <li>the Dane drinks tea</li>
  <li>the green house is on the left of the white house</li>
  <li>the green house’s owner drinks coffee</li>
  <li>the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds</li>
  <li>the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill</li>
  <li>the man living in the center house drinks milk</li>
  <li>the Norwegian lives in the first house</li>
  <li>the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats</li>
  <li>the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill</li>
  <li>the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer</li>
  <li>the German smokes Prince</li>
  <li>the Norwegian lives next to the blue house</li>
  <li>the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge:</h2>

<p>You are challenged to find out who has the fish using the above information and clues.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution:</h2>

<p>The first thing to understand is that though the information seems sparse and disjointed, there is indeed a logical path for you to work out the riddle.</p>

<p>Imagine the houses layed out in a horizontal manner with the first house on your left to the last house on your right.</p>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obZ1VNWm8waHp2NUU/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

<p>Next, we list out all the possibilities for each category. The categories are nationality, colours, drinks, pets, house number and cigarette brand.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nationality
    <ul>
      <li>Norwegian</li>
      <li>Brit</li>
      <li>Dane</li>
      <li>Swede</li>
      <li>German</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Colours
    <ul>
      <li>Blue</li>
      <li>Red</li>
      <li>White</li>
      <li>Yellow</li>
      <li>Green</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drinks
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
      <li>Beer</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pets
    <ul>
      <li>Dogs</li>
      <li>Cats</li>
      <li>Birds</li>
      <li>Horses</li>
      <li>Fishes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>House Number
1,2,3,4,5 respectively for each house from left to right</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cigarette Brand
    <ul>
      <li>Dunhill</li>
      <li>Blends</li>
      <li>BlueMaster</li>
      <li>Pall Mall</li>
      <li>Prince</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now we write whatever we know in a table form. As we gather more and more information from the clues, we fill the table.</p>

<p>We know that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Next, we know that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means that the 2nd house in the row is blue. The man in the center house drinks milk. And we are told that the green house is on the left of the white house and that the green house’s owner drinks coffee. The clue that the green house is on the left of the white house tells that the 4th and 5th houses have to be green and white respectively.</p>

<p>The Brit lives in a red house. The first house has already been occupied by the Norwegian and we know the colours of the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses. This leads us to the fact that the center house is red and the Brit lives there. Also, this leaves the first house to be yellow.</p>

<p>The green house’s owner drinks coffee.</p>

<p>Putting together all these information, we have:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UkHinqI.png" alt="" /></p>

<table style="undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Since the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill, we know the Norwegian smokes Dunhill. Therefore, the 11th clue tells us that the man in the blue house keeps horses.</p>

<p>The 12th clue tells us that the man who smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer must be in the 2nd or 5th house (since the first house is occupied by the Norwegian and men in 3rd and 4th house drink milk and coffee respectively).</p>

<p>Now consider the first house. The options of drinks left for the Norwegian are water, beer and tea. Since the Dane drinks tea, that option is out. Since the Norwegian smokes Dunhill, beer is out. We are left with water.</p>

<p>The last clue makes it evident that the man in the 2nd house smokes blend. That means the man in the last (5th) house smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the option of tea for the 2nd house and hence, it means the Dane lives in the 2nd house.</p>

<p>The current table looks like:</p>

<p>The 13th clue now shows that the only option for the German who smokes Prince is in the 4th house. This leaves the last house for the Swede who has dogs as pets.</p>

<p>The 6th clue shows that the Brit smokes PallMall and rears birds.</p>

<p>The 10th clue shows that either the first or third house has cats. Since the third house has birds, this means that the Norwegian keeps cats.</p>

<p>And we are done.</p>

<p>The finished table will look like this.</p>

	     <p>We all talk about productivity and efficiency today. So here is my way of getting my things done.</p>

<p>I primarily use two platforms to get my stuff done: <a href="https://workflowy.com">Workflowy</a> and <a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>. Workflowy is an amazing platform that is buuilt on a simple idea: making lists. At first look, it may look so simple and plain and even no greater than a Notepad like web-app. But, it is amazing intuitive to use and I am usually able to structure and plan according the the priority of tasks.</p>

<p>I usually think in a structured, top-down way and I would probably attribute that to my engineering-based education. So a typical structure I impose in Workflowy is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Urgent</li>
  <li>Important</li>
  <li>Upcoming</li>
  <li>KIV</li>
</ol>

<p>These are listed in order of priority and shows me which task I need to get done next.</p>

<p>Under each of these categories, I make tasks and their relevant sub-tasks. For example, I have an Engineering exam this coming week, I create a task called “Engineering Exam”. Under this task, I include a label called “Details” which indicates the time, date and location of this task and “Revision” which then contains the relevant sections and chapters to revise as sub-sub-tasks.</p>

<p>One of the greatest things about Workflowy is that you can create many many layers of sub-sub-sub-sub-…. tasks. However, an important feature that is missing is reminders.</p>

<p>For this, I use Google Calendar. All deadlines and events immediately go into my Google Account with a default alert set for 1 and 2 days before the actual date. This together with my list of tasks of Workflowy keeps me organised.</p>

<p>I check this list at the start of the day and update it as and when tasks come in. At the end of the day, I check if all intended tasks for the day have been completed. If yes, I complete them. If no, I move and reschedule them on the level of priority. Before sleeping, I spend 5 minutes working out the relevant tasks and agenda for tomorrow by simply adding a hashtag (#tomrrow) beside the tasks in Workflowy.</p>

<p>This system has worked great so far and I believe it has been a key reason for my productivity too.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

<p>As I was reading The Lost Symbol, by Dan Brown, there was an interesting idea shared which immediately awed me. It deals with the hypothetical question: “Do thoughts have mass?”. Though, on a weighing scale, thoughts may possess mass ranging in the nano to femto scale, if they do have a mass, there will be many implications.</p>

<p>One of which was presented in the book was on gravity. If our thoughts had some mass, they will be bound by the laws of physics. Which meant, they will exert a gravitational force on other matter (though the force is of a very very small scale). Despite the insignificant amount force by a single thought, when a group of people come together to think on the same idea, this collective force becomes significant. It might then start to attract others towards this idea or notion. And that, will be powerful, when a thought can attract others and influence them to think in a certain way too.</p>

<p>Although it is a hypothetical question, the implications simply awed me. Upon further thinking: With thoughts having some mass, they will also be bounded by the Law of Conservation of Energy. Thoughts cannot be destroyed entirely. Instead, the thoughts are simply converted from one thought/idea to another. Or, they may become converted into another form of energy (likely chemical energy) in the brain.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is fascinating to imagine the implications if such a hypothesis was proven to be real. Whether it is true if thoughts have mass or not, only time will tell.</p>

<p>A few of my favourite quotes on the power of thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change your thoughts and you change your world. <br />
<strong>Norman Vincent Peale</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far. <br />
<strong>Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus. <br />
<strong>Alexander Graham Bell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results. <br />
<strong>Wade Boggs</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheers.</p>

	  <title>Most Powerful Thing in the World</title>

	     <p>Have you ever wondered what is the most powerful thing in the world?</p>

<p>Well, its not money, not wealth, maybe love, but really I think its an idea.</p>

<p>Yup, an idea. Every single day, we see ideas that change and craft the world. From the phone in your hand to the computer you’re reading this blog on, every thing around us took root from the idea that came up in someone’s brain.</p>

<p>But when you think about it, an idea isn’t something tangible. Not any physical product you can touch and understand. Nevertheless, you can feel it. And if an idea is powerful enough, it can change the world for the better, or for the worse.</p>

<p>I particularly felt galvanised watching Inception. Inception is basically about implanting someone else’s idea into a target’s subconscious, deep enough, that it changes their way of thinking. Well, an idea seems like a simple thing. But the potential and the potency of an idea goes beyond itself. It creates a chain reaction so complex that without that single idea in a person’s brain, the world might have been different.</p>

<p>The idea right now, in your head is something so powerful. Make sure it is put to good use. To make a change for the better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you really want something, all the Universe conspires in helping you achieve it. -The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a quote I always remember. What you are, who you are is defined by your ideas, your actions. If you have a good idea, and truly believe in it, then give it your best shot. Make your ideas come alive.</p>

	     <p>My Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aashiqui_2">Aashiqui 2</a>. The remake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aashiqui">old hit movie</a>. And it was simply worth every minute. A visual pleasure and an auditory treat, this movie was an outstanding production and brought your emotions to live as well. Despite the characters being newcomers into the industry, their performance was simply outstanding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_Kapoor">Shraddha Kapoor’s</a> innocence and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditya_Roy_Kapur">Aditya Roy Kapoor’s</a> charm simply carries away the hearts of many. The chemistry between the characters was simply intense, pure and at times heart-wrenching. The actors have proved their caliber in this movie by giving their best. Expecting their next release soon.</p>

<h2 id="a-plot-summary">A Plot Summary:</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, Rahul keeps asking Vivek about Aarohi, but Vivek lies to Rahul that he received no calls or whatsoever. Once Rahul recovers, he leaves determined to find Aarohi. He finds her in a bar and realizes that Vivek has been lying to him all these while. Rahul sacks Vivek and convinces Aarohi that he will help her and recounts his situation for the past 2 months. Aarohi decides to trust Rahul for one last time, and agrees to go with him. Soon Rahul gives vocal training for Aarohi and helps her to attain a music contract with his production company. Aarohi becomes a very successful singer and a sensation. While everything seems fine, rumors spread about Rahul and Aarohi.</p>

<p>Rahul becomes distraught about this and gives in to his alcohol addiction. Aarohi who loves him, comforts him and moves in with Rahul despite her mother’s disapproval of her actions. Aarohi slowly helps Rahul to gain control over himself from his addiction. Rahul does fine and involves himself in other activities to keep him away from his addiction. However, an encounter with a journalist who accuses him of using Aarohi for his gains, causes him to turn back to his alcohol addiction for relief. He becomes violent and aggressive.</p>

<p>A saddened Aarohi soon decides that she will take a hiatus from her career to help Rahul. Rahul realises that he is the obstacle in Aarohi’s life and will eventually cause her downfall in her career. One morning, Rahul promises Aarohi that he is going to change himself and focus on diet and a gym regime and drives off following a good-bye with Aarohi. However, it seems that it was his last good-bye as he commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. A devastated Aarohi decides to give up on everything and begins to move out with her parents. Rahul’s friend Vivek meets her, and encourages her to pursue her music career for which Rahul sacrificed his life and assures that it was what Rahul truly wanted.</p>

<p>Aarohi decides to continue her music career and is successful. The film ends with Aarohi signing an autograph for her fans as “Aarohi Rahul Jaykar”.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments:</h2>

<p>A must-watch movie that brings back the emotions and liveliness of a true love story. Despite the sorrow, the movie is able to reach deep within the audience. The songs, both “Tum Hi Ho” and “Sunn Raha Hai” are both amazing and addictive.</p>
