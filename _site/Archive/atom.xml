   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following post is also available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG3207: Computer Architecture &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CG3207 was one of the most informative, educational modules I have taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module answered many of the questions which was always running in my head: “How computers function so smoothly managing several tasks simultaneously?”, “How do the building blocks of computers actually come together in building a computer?”, “How does a processor function?” etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, it was definitely and undoubtedly a challenging module. It requires some fine skills in Assembly and Verilog/VHDL. The course structure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15% Quiz (3 quizzes, Happens during lecture itself)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;45% Labs (Comprises 4 Lab Projects - 1 individual, 3 group)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;40% Finals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 quizzes which occurs during the lecture period itself. They mostly comprise simple questions which test your understanding of 2-3 chapters. The challenging part comes during the labs which take up significant amount of time. Each of the group project are linked which eventually results in a complete processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finals consists of several short-answer questions with a slight emphasis on the last few chapters: Arithmetic for Computers, Memory System Principles, Pipelining, Advanced Processor Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great module. Challenging due to the time involvement for the various group projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG3002: Embedded Systems Design Project &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of signature modules in Computer Engineering. This design project, done in a group of six, is really heavy in terms of the time commitment it requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we were required to build a &lt;strong&gt;indoor&lt;/strong&gt; navigation system for the visually challenged. We were given some equipment to begin with such as Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi (version 1), sensors (infrared, ultrasound etc.), IMU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a new experience for me in putting together software and hardware to achieve an embedded system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading is split into a few checkpoints with the two of the milestones as the major component. This project is definitely not something which can be done by one or two people. Every member in your group must be fully involved, cooperative and motivated to complete the project due to the several tight deadlines you will encounter along the way. Coupled with deadlines from other modules, my team (along with other teams) spent several days staying late at college (sometimes overnight too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of advice for team formation is to have members specialised in various fields such as software, hardware and firmware. It’s crucial to have a kind of leader who can manage deadlines aptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great experience in building the project despite the various tight deadlines which spiked our stress levels at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EG2401: Engineering Professionalism &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module mainly serves to build upon the professional work ethics an engineer should uphold in his/her career. There are 4 main sections revolving around the topics of ethical theories, academic research ethics, plagiarism and professional code, engineering and environmental concerns &amp;amp; intellectual property (copyrights, patents, trademarks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is graded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continual Assessment - 50% (Tutorial Participation - 20%, Research Project - 30%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam - 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, the module has an extra emphasis on the participation during tutorials. The research project mainly involves some research on current fields/topics on engineering with an analysis of the ethics involved in those fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam (closed-book) consists of some structured and essay questions covering the various concepts/practices etc. taught during lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a relatively manageable module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS3244: Machine Learning &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the modules I looked forward most. Though it was pretty different from what I expected, it was somewhat enriching in providing a good overview and understanding of what the field of machine learning is all about and how it is used widely in almost every aspect of our technologies today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the significant amount of math involved in this field initially. The math involved mostly Calculus and Linear Algebra. Coming from a Computer Engineering background I was not very familiar with the parts on Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester machine learning was widely revised under the new professor Prof Kan Min Yen. Prof Min mentioned this syllabus is vastly different from the what was taught in previous semesters. There was equal emphasis on both theory and practical aspects of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof Min followed the content taught at Caltech by Prof Abu Mostafa. It was easy to revise lecture content by watching the Caltech lectures available on YouTube for most of the chapters. The grading of the module comprises the following components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Homework assignments (2 written @ 10%, 1 programming mini project @ 15%): 35%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participation (via IVLE forums, tutorials): 5%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam: 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a challenging module due to the math involved as well as the abstract concepts which take some amount of time to understand and appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE3204: Computer Networks &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module mainly serves as an introduction to computer networks and their developments over the past few decades. The module is divided into 2 main parts by 2 lecturers. Part 1 focuses on introduction of network concepts and ethernet layer. Part 2 covers majorly on the transport and network layers of OSI network architecture and TCP/IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this module to be pretty interesting as it explained how the Internet, something we depend upon for our daily activities, actually functions. The module was graded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socket Programming Lab (20%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm 1 (15%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm 2 (15%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam (50%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module was pretty manageable. Consistency in keeping up with lecture topics was an important factor to do well in the exams and labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheet available &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obclFxSDBXdENRVjA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester was a test of my time-management, leadership skills and determination. Managing the workload of the various modules together with the application for ATAP/Industrial Attachment was definitely not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to my 6 months internship next semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NUS Second Year Second Semester in Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following post is also available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS2010: Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms II &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is one of my favourite modules in this semester. Usually CS2010 is taught by Prof Steven Halim, but it was Dr Brown this semester who is teaching this module for the first time in NUS. Dr Brown was really great and funny as well. He tried to bring across the concepts taught very well and in my opinion one of the coolest professors I have seen. Once I required an extension to one of the important lab assignments and he was so chill about it and totally understands students’ positions. Also, this is a must-take module for any computer science person as it introduces the key algorithms that has made the tech world around us possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course weight he is divided into assignments, labs, lecture quizzes, mid term and final exams. Yes, the weightage is pretty diversified across the various components. It’s important to be consistent in this module as the further weightage for each lab or assignment would also vary depending on the difficulty. The rough breakdown of the course weightage is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In-lecture exercises (8%) – Mini-assignments done during lecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lab exercises (12%) – Similar to assignments but shorter and easier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four Assignments (40%) – Weighted differently depending on difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exams (40%) – Midterm + Final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course structure is basically an introduction to trees, heaps, hash tables in the first half followed by a heavy focus on graphs in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great and crucial module to take for  any computer science or engineering student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2024: Programming for Computer Interfaces &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module was one of the heaviest, if not, the heaviest module I have ever taken. The course mainly focuses on Assembly language in the first half and low-level C programming for computer interfaces in the second half. Both halves consist of a related project done in pairs. While the first project is largely manageable, the second project is huge and is extremely time intensive. In fact, I don’t remember doing anything other than this module in the last 3-4 weeks of the semester. My partner and myself came to NUS at 10am and left at 10pm daily for these weeks. It was an extremely challenging period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip for projects is to 1) Start early &amp;amp; 2) Use the resources around you to learn fully (both online &amp;amp; offline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this module is definitely useful as it gives great in depth understanding of how devices around us were programmed and interfaced, the content was so heavy that I couldn’t get enough time to appreciate everything I learnt. Nevertheless, the module helped me understand the importance of several technologies such as UART, master-slave protocols etc and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were slightly hard as expected. Nevertheless, Prof Rajesh went through all the past year papers one by one during the last few weeks as solutions to the papers are not released. That really helped to clarify a lot of the learning gaps and also on the expectations for the final paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2271: Real-Time Operating Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great module. Took this under Prof Tulika. This is actually the CEG counterpart module of the CS version of Operating Systems. Hence most of the focus was on the lower level areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is structured into labs, midterms and finals. Also, there is a small component for tutorial attendance. Most of the earlier labs are manageable. However, as we moved along into the later parts, I found the labs to be harder not because of the concepts but mostly the debugging of programs and identifying where we went wrong. Hence, it became a little time-intensive too. Labs are done in pairs using a Spark fun (Arduino) kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending lectures (or watching webcasts) is important to help in the understanding. I actually enjoyed this module quite a bit. And after the module was completed, I began appreciating the use of many of the concepts I have learnt. Concepts such as semaphores, mutexes are so crucial and they are being used everywhere around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were pretty hard as compared to the midterms, but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; ST2334: Statistics &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics is a useful and slightly easier than the other modules I took this semester. However, easier means others will also find it easy. I guess the competition for the module was a little high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes were pretty self explanatory out of the times and there are plenty of problems to practice. Both midterms and final exams were pretty okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module structure is mostly based on IVLE quizzes, tutorial attendance, tutorial participation, midterms and finals. Important tip for this module is to be consistent. And the lecturer did make sure we are consistent by giving online quizzes each week and tutorials on alternate weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obZ0RWQkJGYUlLOVE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1oba2UyN2QzRFVRaVU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: B+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2023: Signals &amp;amp; Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals and Systems was an intimidating module for me at first. Looking at so much math and complex terms didn’t help in motivating myself to study. However as time went by, I realised it wasn’t that hard after all. The only requirement to do well in this module is the investment of time. Understanding of the concepts comes over time and dedication  to read the notes again and again. Do this till you understand. Whenever I felt unsure, I used the recommended textbook to write down a few problems and solve then to check my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For midterms and finals, it is very crucial to practice a lot of the past year papers to clarify on the difficulty level and on what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professors were also kind and helpful whenever we approach them with questions. For this module, we just need the discipline to sit down and invest some time in the understanding of the concepts taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obc0NZNUp5T0JoSnM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obMk5kWU5mdk1LM0E&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it was the most hectic semester I’ve had. Till next time, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Lab exercises (12%) – Similar to assignments but shorter and easier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four Assignments (40%) – Weighted differently depending on difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exams (40%) – Midterm + Final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course structure is basically an introduction to trees, heaps, hash tables in the first half followed by a heavy focus on graphs in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great and crucial module to take for  any computer science or engineering student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2024: Programming for Computer Interfaces &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module was one of the heaviest, if not, the heaviest module I have ever taken. The course mainly focuses on Assembly language in the first half and low-level C programming for computer interfaces in the second half. Both halves consist of a related project done in pairs. While the first project is largely manageable, the second project is huge and is extremely time intensive. In fact, I don’t remember doing anything other than this module in the last 3-4 weeks of the semester. My partner and myself came to NUS at 10am and left at 10pm daily for these weeks. It was an extremely challenging period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip for projects is to 1) Start early &amp;amp; 2) Use the resources around you to learn fully (both online &amp;amp; offline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this module is definitely useful as it gives great in depth understanding of how devices around us were programmed and interfaced, the content was so heavy that I couldn’t get enough time to appreciate everything I learnt. Nevertheless, the module helped me understand the importance of several technologies such as UART, master-slave protocols etc and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were slightly hard as expected. Nevertheless, Prof Rajesh went through all the past year papers one by one during the last few weeks as solutions to the papers are not released. That really helped to clarify a lot of the learning gaps and also on the expectations for the final paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2271: Real-Time Operating Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great module. Took this under Prof Tulika. This is actually the CEG counterpart module of the CS version of Operating Systems. Hence most of the focus was on the lower level areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is structured into labs, midterms and finals. Also, there is a small component for tutorial attendance. Most of the earlier labs are manageable. However, as we moved along into the later parts, I found the labs to be harder not because of the concepts but mostly the debugging of programs and identifying where we went wrong. Hence, it became a little time-intensive too. Labs are done in pairs using a Spark fun (Arduino) kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending lectures (or watching webcasts) is important to help in the understanding. I actually enjoyed this module quite a bit. And after the module was completed, I began appreciating the use of many of the concepts I have learnt. Concepts such as semaphores, mutexes are so crucial and they are being used everywhere around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were pretty hard as compared to the midterms, but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; ST2334: Statistics &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics is a useful and slightly easier than the other modules I took this semester. However, easier means others will also find it easy. I guess the competition for the module was a little high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes were pretty self explanatory out of the times and there are plenty of problems to practice. Both midterms and final exams were pretty okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module structure is mostly based on IVLE quizzes, tutorial attendance, tutorial participation, midterms and finals. Important tip for this module is to be consistent. And the lecturer did make sure we are consistent by giving online quizzes each week and tutorials on alternate weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obZ0RWQkJGYUlLOVE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1oba2UyN2QzRFVRaVU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: B+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2023: Signals &amp;amp; Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals and Systems was an intimidating module for me at first. Looking at so much math and complex terms didn’t help in motivating myself to study. However as time went by, I realised it wasn’t that hard after all. The only requirement to do well in this module is the investment of time. Understanding of the concepts comes over time and dedication  to read the notes again and again. Do this till you understand. Whenever I felt unsure, I used the recommended textbook to write down a few problems and solve then to check my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For midterms and finals, it is very crucial to practice a lot of the past year papers to clarify on the difficulty level and on what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professors were also kind and helpful whenever we approach them with questions. For this module, we just need the discipline to sit down and invest some time in the understanding of the concepts taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obc0NZNUp5T0JoSnM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obMk5kWU5mdk1LM0E&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it was the most hectic semester I’ve had. Till next time, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the Data Science Student Challenge which was co-organised and sponsored by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took part in this event together with my friends Alvian, Chris &amp;amp; Ida. We worked tirelessly over just 24 hours to build a full-fledged working application which integrates the concepts of machine learning and data science. And the result of our effort was “Prosper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following extract is from our Github page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;managed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;among&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dozens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some screenshots of the application. You can download and give Prosper a try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/Prosper/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was extremely tiring, it was really a fulfilling experience. In that intense 24 hours, I actually learnt so much skills. It also proved that to learn something new, we only needed the determination and the dedication to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alvian has always been interested in the topics of data science and machine learning. Naturally, he was able to lead our discussion and ideas prior to the building of the actual application. I was in charge of developing the desktop client to communicate with the APIs provided by Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried using simple AJAX calls through a website. However, it did not work due to some error relating to the blockage of “Cross-Origin Requests”. After about 2 hours and going through multiple StackOverflow questions, we decided to change track. I never thought my experience in a previous module, CS2103 Software Engineering, will help me. I used the good old legacy language Java as it was stable and what everyone in my team knew best. Our technology stack was essentially JavaFX to design the layout the GUI and pure Java for the backend logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ida and Chris helped me and Alvian to get the building of the application done. Meanwhile, Alvian started training the model for our app with the data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.gov.sg/developer&quot;&gt;https://data.gov.sg/developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting through the initial round, my team was selected for the finals where we had to present to a panel of judges. It was really a tough experience. Imagine 24 hours++ without sleep and still needing the energy to be able to present lively to the audience in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we did not obtain the top 3 prizes, I was definitely overjoyed to have my team in the 5th place considering that we were all just sophomores in NUS without much experience in these field. I definitely look forward to participating in the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;managed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;among&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dozens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some screenshots of the application. You can download and give Prosper a try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/Prosper/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was extremely tiring, it was really a fulfilling experience. In that intense 24 hours, I actually learnt so much skills. It also proved that to learn something new, we only needed the determination and the dedication to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alvian has always been interested in the topics of data science and machine learning. Naturally, he was able to lead our discussion and ideas prior to the building of the actual application. I was in charge of developing the desktop client to communicate with the APIs provided by Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried using simple AJAX calls through a website. However, it did not work due to some error relating to the blockage of “Cross-Origin Requests”. After about 2 hours and going through multiple StackOverflow questions, we decided to change track. I never thought my experience in a previous module, CS2103 Software Engineering, will help me. I used the good old legacy language Java as it was stable and what everyone in my team knew best. Our technology stack was essentially JavaFX to design the layout the GUI and pure Java for the backend logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ida and Chris helped me and Alvian to get the building of the application done. Meanwhile, Alvian started training the model for our app with the data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.gov.sg/developer&quot;&gt;https://data.gov.sg/developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting through the initial round, my team was selected for the finals where we had to present to a panel of judges. It was really a tough experience. Imagine 24 hours++ without sleep and still needing the energy to be able to present lively to the audience in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we did not obtain the top 3 prizes, I was definitely overjoyed to have my team in the 5th place considering that we were all just sophomores in NUS without much experience in these field. I definitely look forward to participating in the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;screenshots&quot;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Ask NOC - Honestbee & Shopback Sharing Session</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/askNOC-Session-Review"/>
   <updated>2016-01-28T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//askNOC Session Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I attended 2 talks during askNOC. There were two invited guests: Jonathan Low from Honestbee and Henry Chan from Shopback. Both companies are startups, having only been in the market for around a year or so. Today’s sharing was largely focused on their business and how they overcame the various challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestbee is a concierge and online delivery service for grocery shopping. So essentially, customers can place orders online for groceries or items found at common supermarkets such as NTUC. The ‘bees’ from the company are actuallly people who will shop the necessary items and deliver them to you in an hour. I personally found this a great idea for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is a huge incentive for consumers to use this product because there are no additional costs. The items are bought at the same prevailing price at the supermarket. Secondly, consumers can order from the convenience of their home. Thirdly, as mentioned by Jonathan, this is an asset light model. There are no storage or warehouse involved. Every purchase is made directly at the supermarket which means storage is well taken care of. Essentially, the only services that they are providing will be the shopping and delivery of items. They are able to grow well with the use of technology. For example, internally they use an Android app that allows ‘bees’ to receive orders. Nevertheless, Jonathan mentioned that currently it is still exists as a manual process. This can definitely be automated to reduced much of the overhead costs. An order can immediately be routed to a free ‘bee’ together with the list of items etc. Doing so will help save time and manpower costs as well as allow them to garner good analytics into the demographics and patterns of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about how Honestbee works, Jonathan also provided some good insights into the business model. They utilise a revenue share model. Taking an example of an order of $100, they will be able to obtain a 20% commission. Out of this $20, their overall profit is only $10 as shown below.
$20-$5(shopper cost)-$5(delivery  cost) = $10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several teams in Honestbee which work together. These include: business, customer service, product (engineering, design, data), operations teams. He emphasised the crucial need for each of these teams to work hand in hand and communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan also shared the various challenges he faced. Factoring in the customer acquisition costs, each customer only turns profitable from the fifth order onwards. Also, he mentioned the poor visibility they have on stock availability. This is especially true due to their reliance on the supermarket to have the various products they are looking for.
Also, delivery costs are only minimised with economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by Henry Chan from Shopback. Shopback is based on the idea of customers getting cashbacks on their online purchases. Henry provided some great insights on e-commerce as a whole. He pointed out that e-commerce in Southeast Asia has a very low penetration rate which essentially means a huge growth opportunity for the next 5-6 years. One of the key markets to tap on will be Indonesia where online shopping and mobile penetration rates are growing rapidly. Henry also emphasised that entrepreneurs must be willing to learn and have the hunger to achieve and that expanding your business is all about having the right people around you. This pointed out the importance of networking, about having good contacts in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked how his business adapts to smaller markets where technology is generally less advanced, he said that such a situation is indeed a good opportunity where you can have greater expansion and tap deeper into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting questions was if both the founders give employees stock options. I felt that this is a great way to align employees’ interests together with the company’s goals. While stock options may not guarantee any value, this orientation towards a common goal is crucial in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, both of them provided an important tip for budding entrepreneurs:Don’t be shy in validating your idea. One of them even mentioned, that they requested people in Starbucks to test drive their prototype and gain feedback. I am sure validation is a crucial part every new product has to achieve and this must be done early in the prototyping stage itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnt a lot from this session and definitely looking forward to the next session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Second Year | First Semester in Review</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Second-Year,-First-Semester-in-Review"/>
   <updated>2015-12-22T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Second Year, First Semester in Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following blog post is also available on my Wordpress site &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/second-year-first-semester-in-review/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past semester is definitely the busiest semester I have been through. There was literally no time for anything else other than studies and projects. Part of the reason (as you will see), is that I took 8 modules this time. However, one of them, CP3108B - Orbital has already been completed. Two of the other modules CP2201 and CFG1001 lasted only for the first half of the semester, thankfully. This allowed for a slightly relaxed timetable in the second half of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really glad that I managed to do my best through the semester. And for those who are anticipating such a semester, I felt you might find a review of the modules handy. So here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP 2201: Journey of the Innovator &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a module about entrepreneurship and is worth 2 MCs. The grading is also in the form of Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or Completed Unsatisfactorily (CU) which means that the grade obtained will not affect the current CAP you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I found this module to be very engaging and entertaining. It provided me with what I wanted to learn about entrepreneurship. Each week, there were invited guest speakers who share their experience on entrepreneurship. A typical outline of the module looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 1: Introduction to module and some basic information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 2: Guest speakers from PropertyGuru and Reebonz with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 3: Guest speakers from upcoming startups: Klinify, Lomotif and InvestingNote with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 4: Guest speakers from Red Dot Ventures and Golden Gate Venture with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, there will be a short assignment which requires some reflection on various aspects of entrepreneurship as well as the guest speakers and the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a great module to learn from entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Oh did I mention that there is a buffet dinner and networking session for 30 mins weekly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS2101: Effective Communication for Computing Professionals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a twinned module with CS2103T (see below). Basically, this module teaches you to write and present your ideas in an effective manner. Communication skills, writing skills and presentation skills are the 3 most crucial skills required to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this module good as I was able to pick up on the above-mentioned skills. However, there are a number of continual assessments for this module since there are no final exams. This means you will be kept busy almost every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some of the CAs are simple activities like doing a reflection on communication or your oral presentations. Some of the assessments I remember doing are:
- Reflection on Communication Skills &amp;amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Oral Presentation 1 (OP1)
- Writing a Project Proposal
- Writing of a Progress Report on the software project
- Oral Presentation 2 (OP2)
- Reflection 2 on OP2 &amp;amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Writing of a Project Manual (Developer and User Guide)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do well in this module, it is crucial to have the enthusiasm and appreciation for what you are doing. Of course, that will also help you to be more participative in your class (participation is also counted for grading). Also, I cannot emphasise enough on having a good team who can support you in these tasks. This is definitely not a one-man-army type of module for you to do alone. Effective teamwork is important in bringing out the best in most parts of the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS2013T - Software Engineering &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been looking forward to this module for some time. Personally, I love software engineering and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module was personally very enriching and I got to learn a lot in terms of the various software engineering principles. That being said, this is one of the most hectic modules. As a team of 4, we were tasked to build a desktop-based task manager from scratch which had a primary input through the keyboard. By task manager, I mean a productivity software akin to popular ones like Google Keep, Todoist, Wunderlist, Any.do etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grading of the module was divided into 3 main areas: Project (50%), Final Exam (40%) and Participation (10%). As such, the project hold the majority of the weightage and that makes this module different from conventional ones. We apply what we learn. Every week, the lecture introduces new principles and concepts relevant to software engineering. Much of these knowledge can be immediately applied to the project we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS2103T is also twinned with CS2101 (as described above). Hence, many of the things we do such as developer’s guide, user guide etc. are relevant to the project. The use of version control (Git or GitHub) is extremely crucial for the project and came in really handy. We are prone to introduce bugs/errors when 3-4 people “operate” on the code simultaneously. Having revision control allowed such to keep track of these changes and simply revert our changes if we found them to be buggy later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation segment is the easiest to score and you should definitely score the full 10% here. Points can be earned through the proper completion of pre-tutorial and in-tutorial activities, answering questions in lectures, successful completion of weekly lectures quizzes on IVLE etc. There is maximum cap of 200 points which means that any points exceeding the 200th mark will not contribute to the participation points for grading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam tests the skills we have learnt throughout the semester. If you have learnt and applied these concepts well for the software project, it will be much easier to score here. The CS2103T module handbook (a 200-page document/textbook companion) is a must-read for scoring well for the exams. It helps to reinforce the concepts learnt and clears the small gaps in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I learnt a lot through this module. My team and I managed to create quite a cool desktop application called “FINI”. The name inspired from French, in which Fini refers to finished or accomplished. We felt that this accurately represents the goal of our app and it was easy to remember too! 
These are some of the screenshots of the application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/rwUcDNl.png&quot; alt=&quot;FINI&#39;s Welcome Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OIFjxyi.png&quot; alt=&quot;FINI&#39;s Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, my team and I became really passionate about what we were doing and we even made a cool video for our Oral Presentation 2 in CS2101 and to also serve as an introductory product demo video during our CS2103T demonstration. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an interesting yet hectic module. If you love creating cool stuff, you will love this module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2020 - Digital Fundamentals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 5MCs module which is split into 2 parts. The first part is relatively easier to understand and introduces the basic building blocks of computers such as logic gates. The second part is focused mostly on slightly more intricate topics such as Finite State Machines (FSMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also lab and project components in this module. The labs are mostly manageable and primarily introduces the use of FPGAs and the hardware description language known as Verilog. The project is done individually and it involved creating an oscilloscope out of the FPGA. This was really cool because oscilloscopes generally cost many hundreds of dollars. Using a simple FPGA to create an oscilloscope was indeed interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it involved writing Verilog for the FPGA to interpret and display the incoming signal from the signal generators in the lab. The project was graded individually with a range of criteria. Two main influencing factors are the number of features (such as scaling, translating, displaying words/labels, pointers) and the uniqueness of the features &lt;em&gt;as compared to your peers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no final exams. Instead there is a midterm quiz and final quiz (each 20%) and the rest of the assessment is based on labs and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, a manageable module. Be creative with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2021 - Devices and Circuits &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module has a lot of theory and formulas on semiconductors. Personally, I found it quite intensive and usually took me the most time out of all my modules to revise and gain a complete understanding of what was being taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment for this module is Homework (10%), Midterm test (20%), Quiz (5%), Final Exam (65%), though I do not remember taking a quiz for the 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics covered were very structured starting from the building blocks and slowly moving on to bigger components: Semiconductors -&amp;gt; PN junctions -&amp;gt; Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT) -&amp;gt; Metal Oxide Semiconductors Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) -&amp;gt; CMOS Logic -&amp;gt; Single Stage Amplifiers -&amp;gt; Multistage Amplifiers -&amp;gt; Opamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was really overwhelming and was like a bit of PC1432 again. The first part (before midterms) is usually much easier to understand than the second part. So make sure you ace the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, a difficult module indeed due to the time commitment for understanding and revision. If you can appreciate what you learn, it will greatly help in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; LAF1201 - French 1 &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this module out of curiosity and the eagerness to learn a new language. I had shortlisted Chinese, Hindi and French and finally decided on French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Firstly, we need to understand that learning a language takes considerable time and effort to both learn, grasp and then practice speaking it. And doing all this while juggling other modules during a period of 1 semester is not a joke. French is apparently written with English alphabets with some accented ones. Also, it is similar to English or rather English is similar to French. As compared to other languages like Chinese and Hindi, this meant that I do not need to spend extra time learning to write the new alphabets which would help to save a considerable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say French was really awesome. The people I met were mostly from FASS, but there were a few of them like me from Engineering or some from Pharmacy and Business. I really liked like environment. It was very interactive and my lecturer Dr Daniel Chan made sure everyone participated in each lesson. The interaction and fun during lessons made me like French even more. To ensure this interaction, all lessons are tutorials (no lectures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workload wise, since there are no final exams, you will be having tests / quizzes / homework more frequently than you would have expected to. There are quizzes on the French culture, vocabulary, grammar, audio recording of a self-introduction, writing of an email for an imaginative scenario etc. The final test is an oral conversation between 2 you and two others from your group in front of the lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say it is relatively easy to score for the tests if you have consistently practised French (both writing and speaking). That being said, also means that your peers will score well. Personal advice is to revise the notes posted on IVLE and use Google Translate to its fullest capability. I also utilised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; app (web &amp;amp; mobile) to learn much of the content. Oh yes, if you have an iPhone, you can set the language for Siri as French and converse with it in French. It’s quite cool and you can also check on your pronunciation by seeing if Siri understands what you just said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very enjoyable module taught by a great lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP3108B - Independent Work (Orbital Programme) &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Orbital programme during the summer break before my semester 1. I have written a post on the Orbital experience which is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/blog/education/nus/college/techstuff/2015/08/19/Orbital%202015/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/orbital-2015&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CFG1001 - Headstart Module &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a 0 MCs module to prepare you for your career, there is a reason I have written about it here. Before attending the sessions, I was a little complacent and thought of this module as something that is snatching my precious time away. However, upon attending the module, I thought differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module helps to expose how it is like in the “real” world outside of NUS. Preparing for a career also includes preparing for the various interviews, networking with others etc. And it helped me understand and appreciate the importance of many skills and pointers which will definitely come in handy during my interview applications etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is graded with a Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or CU (Completed Unsatisfactorily) grade. You’ll just need to attend all the 2-3 face-to-face sessions to get a CS grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): (Nil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I just realised I have 4 consecutive exams in the coming semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess I need to mentally prepare for it. After all, the only easy semester was the last semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Second Year, First Semester in Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following blog post is also available on my Wordpress site &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/second-year-first-semester-in-review/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past semester is definitely the busiest semester I have been through. There was literally no time for anything else other than studies and projects. Part of the reason (as you will see), is that I took 8 modules this time. However, one of them, CP3108B - Orbital has already been completed. Two of the other modules CP2201 and CFG1001 lasted only for the first half of the semester, thankfully. This allowed for a slightly relaxed timetable in the second half of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really glad that I managed to do my best through the semester. And for those who are anticipating such a semester, I felt you might find a review of the modules handy. So here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP 2201: Journey of the Innovator &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a module about entrepreneurship and is worth 2 MCs. The grading is also in the form of Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or Completed Unsatisfactorily (CU) which means that the grade obtained will not affect the current CAP you have.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Week 3: Guest speakers from upcoming startups: Klinify, Lomotif and InvestingNote with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 4: Guest speakers from Red Dot Ventures and Golden Gate Venture with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, there will be a short assignment which requires some reflection on various aspects of entrepreneurship as well as the guest speakers and the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a great module to learn from entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

Oh yes, if you have an iPhone, you can set the language for Siri as French and converse with it in French. It’s quite cool and you can also check on your pronunciation by seeing if Siri understands what you just said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very enjoyable module taught by a great lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP3108B - Independent Work (Orbital Programme) &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Orbital programme during the summer break before my semester 1. I have written a post on the Orbital experience which is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/blog/education/nus/college/techstuff/2015/08/19/Orbital%202015/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/orbital-2015&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆	☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CFG1001 - Headstart Module &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a 0 MCs module to prepare you for your career, there is a reason I have written about it here. Before attending the sessions, I was a little complacent and thought of this module as something that is snatching my precious time away. However, upon attending the module, I thought differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module helps to expose how it is like in the “real” world outside of NUS. Preparing for a career also includes preparing for the various interviews, networking with others etc. And it helped me understand and appreciate the importance of many skills and pointers which will definitely come in handy during my interview applications etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is graded with a Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or CU (Completed Unsatisfactorily) grade. You’ll just need to attend all the 2-3 face-to-face sessions to get a CS grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): (Nil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I just realised I have 4 consecutive exams in the coming semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess I need to mentally prepare for it. After all, the only easy semester was the last semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Solving Einstein's Riddle</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Solving-Einstein's-Riddle"/>
   <updated>2015-12-07T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Solving Einstein's Riddle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IgXHPOF.jpg &quot; alt=&quot;Einstein&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting riddle written by Einstein in the last century. He claimed that &lt;strong&gt;98%&lt;/strong&gt; of the people in the world will not be able to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-riddle&quot;&gt;The Riddle:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 5 different houses, each of a different colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a owner of a different nationality in each house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the owner drinks a specific type of drink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner smokes a specific type of cigarettes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner has a specific type of pet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;None of the owners drink the same drink / smoke the same cigarette brand / have the same type of pets / have same nationality / live in the same house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-clues&quot;&gt;The Clues:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Brit lives in the red house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Swede keeps dogs as pets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Dane drinks tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house is on the left of the white house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house’s owner drinks coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man living in the center house drinks milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives in the first house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the German smokes Prince&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives next to the blue house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are challenged to find out who has the fish using the above information and clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that though the information seems sparse and disjointed, there is indeed a logical path for you to work out the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the houses layed out in a horizontal manner with the first house on your left to the last house on your right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obZ1VNWm8waHp2NUU/preview&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we list out all the possibilities for each category. The categories are nationality, colours, drinks, pets, house number and cigarette brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nationality
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Norwegian&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dane&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Swede&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Colours
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;White&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Yellow&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Beer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pets
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dogs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Birds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fishes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House Number
1,2,3,4,5 respectively for each house from left to right&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cigarette Brand
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blends&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;BlueMaster&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pall Mall&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prince&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we write whatever we know in a table form. As we gather more and more information from the clues, we fill the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Next, we know that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means that the 2nd house in the row is blue. The man in the center house drinks milk. And we are told that the green house is on the left of the white house and that the green house’s owner drinks coffee. The clue that the green house is on the left of the white house tells that the 4th and 5th houses have to be green and white respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brit lives in a red house. The first house has already been occupied by the Norwegian and we know the colours of the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses. This leads us to the fact that the center house is red and the Brit lives there. Also, this leaves the first house to be yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green house’s owner drinks coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting together all these information, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/UkHinqI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill, we know the Norwegian smokes Dunhill. Therefore, the 11th clue tells us that the man in the blue house keeps horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th clue tells us that the man who smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer must be in the 2nd or 5th house (since the first house is occupied by the Norwegian and men in 3rd and 4th house drink milk and coffee respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the first house. The options of drinks left for the Norwegian are water, beer and tea. Since the Dane drinks tea, that option is out. Since the Norwegian smokes Dunhill, beer is out. We are left with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last clue makes it evident that the man in the 2nd house smokes blend. That means the man in the last (5th) house smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the option of tea for the 2nd house and hence, it means the Dane lives in the 2nd house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current table looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Zi95yp8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blend&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dunhill&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13th clue now shows that the only option for the German who smokes Prince is in the 4th house. This leaves the last house for the Swede who has dogs as pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6th clue shows that the Brit smokes PallMall and rears birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th clue shows that either the first or third house has cats. Since the third house has birds, this means that the Norwegian keeps cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished table will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Coffee&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Prince&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fish&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blends&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;PallMall&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Birds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;

   <title>Solving Einstein's Riddle</title>

   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Solving Einstein's Riddle</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IgXHPOF.jpg &quot; alt=&quot;Einstein&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting riddle written by Einstein in the last century. He claimed that &lt;strong&gt;98%&lt;/strong&gt; of the people in the world will not be able to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-riddle&quot;&gt;The Riddle:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 5 different houses, each of a different colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a owner of a different nationality in each house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the owner drinks a specific type of drink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner smokes a specific type of cigarettes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner has a specific type of pet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;None of the owners drink the same drink / smoke the same cigarette brand / have the same type of pets / have same nationality / live in the same house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-clues&quot;&gt;The Clues:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Brit lives in the red house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Swede keeps dogs as pets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Dane drinks tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house is on the left of the white house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house’s owner drinks coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man living in the center house drinks milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives in the first house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the German smokes Prince&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives next to the blue house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are challenged to find out who has the fish using the above information and clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that though the information seems sparse and disjointed, there is indeed a logical path for you to work out the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the houses layed out in a horizontal manner with the first house on your left to the last house on your right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obZ1VNWm8waHp2NUU/preview&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we list out all the possibilities for each category. The categories are nationality, colours, drinks, pets, house number and cigarette brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nationality
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Norwegian&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dane&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Swede&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Colours
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;White&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Yellow&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Beer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pets
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dogs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Birds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fishes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House Number
1,2,3,4,5 respectively for each house from left to right&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cigarette Brand
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blends&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;BlueMaster&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pall Mall&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prince&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we write whatever we know in a table form. As we gather more and more information from the clues, we fill the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Next, we know that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means that the 2nd house in the row is blue. The man in the center house drinks milk. And we are told that the green house is on the left of the white house and that the green house’s owner drinks coffee. The clue that the green house is on the left of the white house tells that the 4th and 5th houses have to be green and white respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brit lives in a red house. The first house has already been occupied by the Norwegian and we know the colours of the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses. This leads us to the fact that the center house is red and the Brit lives there. Also, this leaves the first house to be yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green house’s owner drinks coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting together all these information, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/UkHinqI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill, we know the Norwegian smokes Dunhill. Therefore, the 11th clue tells us that the man in the blue house keeps horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th clue tells us that the man who smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer must be in the 2nd or 5th house (since the first house is occupied by the Norwegian and men in 3rd and 4th house drink milk and coffee respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the first house. The options of drinks left for the Norwegian are water, beer and tea. Since the Dane drinks tea, that option is out. Since the Norwegian smokes Dunhill, beer is out. We are left with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last clue makes it evident that the man in the 2nd house smokes blend. That means the man in the last (5th) house smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the option of tea for the 2nd house and hence, it means the Dane lives in the 2nd house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current table looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Zi95yp8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blend&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dunhill&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13th clue now shows that the only option for the German who smokes Prince is in the 4th house. This leaves the last house for the Swede who has dogs as pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6th clue shows that the Brit smokes PallMall and rears birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th clue shows that either the first or third house has cats. Since the third house has birds, this means that the Norwegian keeps cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished table will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Coffee&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Prince&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fish&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blends&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;PallMall&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Birds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Beer&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;BlueMaster&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;White&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dunhill&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cats&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only leaves us with the German who must have the fish. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <updated>2015-12-06T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Gamecraft 2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/KnFi8cM.png &quot; alt=&quot;TwistedMaze Logo&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently participated in Gamecraft 2015. This is my 2nd time participating this is “game-hackathon”. This time my team consisted of Al, Ted, Chris &amp;amp; myself. The theme for this year was “Twist”. As usual, the interpretation of this theme in relation to the game was left open to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that came to my mind was a maze that twists. As I was imagining this idea, I suddenly had this inspiration from this book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner&quot;&gt;The Mazerunner&lt;/a&gt;. It is a book where a group of “hostages” have to escape from a ever-changing labyrinth. There has also been a movie released with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggested this idea and we tried brainstorming a few ideas before settling and finalising on this one. After this decision, we focused our efforts towards the game development. Me and Chris took on the roles of the game design where we made the shifting maps for the maze and the necessary sprites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted was the sound engineer and gather suitable sounds for use in the game. Al, being the lead programmer of the group, devoted his attention to the game physics and the actual coding of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We utilised Unity for the game and eventually (after 24 hrs) managed to come up with a finished game, TwistedMaze. TwistedMaze is available for download (both Mac and Windows versions) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/TwistedMaze/releases&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work on porting the game to Android and iOS is currently being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Getting Things Done (GTD) Framework</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/My-Getting-Things-Done-(GTD)-Framework"/>
   <updated>2015-12-03T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//My Getting Things Done (GTD) Framework</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all talk about productivity and efficiency today. So here is my way of getting my things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I primarily use two platforms to get my stuff done: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflowy.com&quot;&gt;Workflowy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. Workflowy is an amazing platform that is buuilt on a simple idea: making lists. At first look, it may look so simple and plain and even no greater than a Notepad like web-app. But, it is amazing intuitive to use and I am usually able to structure and plan according the the priority of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually think in a structured, top-down way and I would probably attribute that to my engineering-based education. So a typical structure I impose in Workflowy is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urgent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upcoming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;KIV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are listed in order of priority and shows me which task I need to get done next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under each of these categories, I make tasks and their relevant sub-tasks. For example, I have an Engineering exam this coming week, I create a task called “Engineering Exam”. Under this task, I include a label called “Details” which indicates the time, date and location of this task and “Revision” which then contains the relevant sections and chapters to revise as sub-sub-tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest things about Workflowy is that you can create many many layers of sub-sub-sub-sub-…. tasks. However, an important feature that is missing is reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I use Google Calendar. All deadlines and events immediately go into my Google Account with a default alert set for 1 and 2 days before the actual date. This together with my list of tasks of Workflowy keeps me organised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check this list at the start of the day and update it as and when tasks come in. At the end of the day, I check if all intended tasks for the day have been completed. If yes, I complete them. If no, I move and reschedule them on the level of priority. Before sleeping, I spend 5 minutes working out the relevant tasks and agenda for tomorrow by simply adding a hashtag (#tomrrow) beside the tasks in Workflowy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system has worked great so far and I believe it has been a key reason for my productivity too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Lessons from Entrepreneurs</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Lessons-from-Entrepreneurs"/>
   <updated>2015-12-02T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Lessons from Entrepreneurs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past semester, I undertook a module in NUS known as “Journey of the Innovator” (CP2201). More than just a module, it was conducted in an interesting and engaging seminar style. Each week, many lessons on entrepreneurship were shared and in one of the weeks, 3 startup founders were invited to share their views and insights into entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;klinify&quot;&gt;Klinify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk was by Krish, the CEO and Founder of Klinify. Personally, I found Klinify’s mission to “provide the freedom of paper with the power of digital technology” intriguing. It aims to propagate a change within the medical industry and empower doctors to harness the strengths of technology to further improve the medical services being delivered. During his talk, Krish mentioned some importants points on entrepreneurship that he has learnt thus far. I have combined those pointers, together with my learning points from the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on a specific sector: Klinify’s target audience are very specific. It is specifically targeted at the providers of medical service, doctors. While their ultimate goal is to extend the platform of Klinify globally, their current milestone is to establish themselves in Singapore and in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Klinify offers hybrid storage: This might be a little technical. Conventionally, a patients records (in paper) are only available physcially in the hospital. However, by digitalizing medical recors, now patient records are both available locally and on the cloud. By sharing it on the cloud, the medical records are now more accessible than ever. This could even offer a centralised patient records system to help doctors view and understand the patient’s medical history well before treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reasons for Klinify’s potential success: Klinify does not aim to change doctors’ natural way of doing things. Their workflow remains the same. Doctors are still able to write like they do on paper. They have customised templates. They can attach photos and even annotate. All these features help doctors to transition from their current pen-and-paper workflow to the digital platform with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some concerns on Klinify: Security. Technology rules today’s world. However, the growth of technology has brought about potential incentives for people to expose data. Medical records are meant to be private. In an event of a security breach, millions of medical records can be leaked. However, during the talk, Krish did mention their focus to ensure the safety and privacy of patient records. And only a strong defence system can deter such security compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lomotif&quot;&gt;Lomotif&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by Paul from Lomotif. Lomotif is essentially a mobile application that allows users to create a video from their stash of videos and even add songs to it. After using it, a clear winning point of Lomotif was the usability factor. It was very simple to use and even a novice mobile user will be able to use it easily. 
Some pointers from Paul:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market saturation: There will be a point in time when your target market becomes saturated. And Paul mentions that we should definitely anticipate this. To overcome this, we need to try and leverage on another market. I think this can be done in a couple of ways. Various markets are segmented by factors such as age, culture and perception. Hence, an expansion into another market requires a change in the app / technology that addresses one or more of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some interesting features of Lomotif: It’s collaborative, expressive and fun. This fun factor is one of the main reasons which helps Lomotif stand out from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 Crucial Factors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Good Team&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Customer Acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Making your customers happy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;investing-note&quot;&gt;Investing Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third talk was by Shanison from InvestingNote. InvestingNote is a social network site targeted specifically at investors in Singapore and in the regional space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon using the InvestingNote platform, I like the user-friendly interface and the summarised view of stocks/shares and other information. Personally, I believe that such a social-platform can be of great use to investors. Facilitating communication among investors is something new I have seen and if brought about to the target market correctly, I believe this can be a good success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the above pointers are critical in ensuring the success of the start-up. While it may be true that most start-ups fail eventually, I think keeping the above pointers in mind will definitely aid them to beat the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Entrepreneurship - Yay or Nay?</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Entrepreneurship-Yay-or-Nay"/>
   <updated>2015-08-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Entrepreneurship Yay or Nay?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as&quot;&gt;Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think big, and expand big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru&quot;&gt;Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Size and Valuation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good M&amp;amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp;amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes I found during the presentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz&quot;&gt;The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximise existing resources to create value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Instead of finding places where there is already competition, find niche areas where you can dominate the business”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“See opportunities in problems”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Get a MVP, or beta model and launch it. Only then you will receive feedback on what the market wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Only the paranoid survives” – Quoted from Andrew Grove, Co-Founder of Intel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very fruitful session that stirred up the entrepreneur within me. The world needs change, and only innovation can drive that change. And entrepreneurs can lead that innovation. In that regard, I am motivated to become an entrepreneur myself to help make positive difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Entrepreneurship - Yay or Nay?</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Entrepreneurship-Yay-or-Nay"/>
   <updated>2015-08-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Entrepreneurship Yay or Nay?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as&quot;&gt;Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think big, and expand big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru&quot;&gt;Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Size and Valuation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good M&amp;amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp;amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes I found during the presentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz&quot;&gt;The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximise existing resources to create value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Orbital 2015</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Orbital-2015"/>
   <updated>2015-08-19T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Orbital 2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/5EjaKFa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Friendezvous&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 months of hard work, the Orbital programme came to a close on 19th Aug 2015. It was a great experience and I picked up many skills of both front and back end development. I did the project with Al who was very supportive during the 3 months though he was on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s inspiration came from our shared experiences in daily college life. Many of the times we tend to organise meetings manually. A typical process goes like this (A,B,C are persons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A–&amp;gt;B: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? &lt;br /&gt;
B–&amp;gt;A: Yup, that’ll be good I guess. &lt;br /&gt;
A–&amp;gt;C: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? &lt;br /&gt;
C–&amp;gt;A: Oh no, I don’t think I’ll be free. How about some other day? &lt;br /&gt;
A (thinks to him/herself): Darn, got to ask B and C for another timing again! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the typical manual process is tedious where we often WhatsApp or message one another for free slots and try to match it all up for a common time to meet. In the point of view of the meeting administrator, it is a rather painstaking process when he/she has to repeatedly ask the team members for a suitable time to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this issue, I suggested to Al that we should maybe develop a platform which can make the organising of meetings simpler and redefine the ways of doing so. And from there, Friendezvous was born. Friendezvous is an amalgamation of the words Friend and Rendezvous (a meeting at an agreed time and place). So essentially Friendezvous refers to meetings with friends, colleagues etc. And we decided on a relevant tagline as well: “Organising meetings, redefined.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I should describe a little of the technical aspects of Friendezvous as well. Friendezvous was built using the good old LAMP stack. We used PHP and MySQL along with front-end technologies/frameworks such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap (modified), Angular JS. The development itself was not the difficult part. The hardest part of this journey was to think as an user of this platform. How would an user using Friendezvous feel about the workflow of this app? Is it too complicated? Can we improve on the workflow to minimise the number of steps/clicks an user is required to make to achieve an objective? These are the various questions which were running on our minds all the time. After all, software/app development is not just about blinding writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with real life users here. Then, we decided to conduct a survey to analyse the perception of our target audience towards the platform. We did it with a closed circle of friends and received very positive feedback. It was definitely a morale booster to our idea and efforts. More than anything, we were passionate about what we did. Even if we made a positive difference in a single person’s life, it would mean a lot to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbital Splashdown, where all the teams (from beginner, intermediate &amp;amp; advanced levels) came together to showcase their work, was held on 19th August 2015. It was exhilarating to see so many applications built by students like myself. I was inspired by many apps, with their technical aspects as well as the business models they were planning to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was extremely joyful when the visitors to my booth exclaimed “Wow, that is one app I think I would use!” or “This is an excellent app bro!”. They were also impressed at the various features like notification tracking and location suggestions Friendezvous offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, Orbital 2015 was an exciting journey. I am going to make it a point to develop an application every summer. I find fulfilment in learning so many technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Friendezvous, currently it is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://friendezvous.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;Friendezvous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development is very active and Al and myself aim to launch Friendezvous as a commercial platform soon (in about 3-5 months). After which, we are planning on porting this towards an Android and iOS application as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do try Friendezvous if you can and send me your comments in the comment box on my blog or to my &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#055;&amp;#064;&amp;#108;&amp;#105;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NUS First Year | Semester 4 | (Special Term 2) in Review</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/NUS-First-Year,-Semester-4-(Special-Term-)"/>
   <updated>2015-08-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NUS First Year, Semester 4 (Special Term ||)</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CyberSecurity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Computer Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being quite free during the summer vacation period, I decided to take up CS2107: Introduction to Information and System Security in Special Term 2. It was one of the most interesting modules I have taken taught by an ever youthful professor Hugh. His energy and enthusiasm and deep knowledge on computer security made me even more curious in the various aspects of computer security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module covers a wide range of topics from cryptography/ciphers, to common hacking methods (SQLi, Buffer overflows), protection mechanisms against such malcious attacks etc. The assessment was split into the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Homework &amp;amp; Assignments&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Project Work&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Final Exam&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 3 assignments (about 5-10 questions) which were to be done at home. They were largely manageable. Google is your best friend. Computer security is a broad topic and the more you learn, the better you understand and appreciate the various concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project work was indeed an interesting experience. My team consisted of Sri (not his real name), QY and myself. It was a tight timeline considering that the project was to be completed over a span of just 6 weeks. We embarked on the project about 2 weeks before submission, but we made the structure of the report very clear. Regular consultation with Prof Hugh was crucial in helping us achieve a clear understanding of the expectations of this project. As a team, we are really thankful for his advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project was on “Common attacks on PC/UNIX/Mac devices”. Here focused on DDoS, Buffer Overflow exploitation and side-channel attacks. I personally involved myself largely towards the buffer overflow section in which I did code sample runs to check the implementation of a feature known as Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) on Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. We also compared the effectiveness the various operating systems against the aforementioned attacks and concluded Windows offered the best protection (of course, in reality there will be a wide range of external factors to be considered as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam was manageable. I was able to refer to the relevant sections of the notes since it was an open-book examination. Some questions are specifically targeted at your understanding and some were on concepts mentioned in lectures. I guess it paid off to attend each and every lecture and tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really glad I took this module. It is one of the best modules I have taken in NUS thus far and am currently contemplating taking CS3235 (Introduction to Computer Security) sometime later. Then again, the number of required breadth electives for CEG students has been reduced to just 1 which means I need to plan my modules well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also taking it in Special Term was great since it allowed me to concentrate fully on one subject. In the regular semester, with 5-6 modules, juggling time between these modules itself is a huge task for most students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: &lt;strong&gt;Manageable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Grade obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Remarks: Pretty interesting module taught by an amazing professor. Take it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got a Google Cardboard yesterday. The Google Cardboard comes as a laser-cut template (which you have fold and fix yourself), two 45mm biconvex lenses, 2 neodymium magnets, 2 pairs of velcro and a rubberband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really simple to fold and use and all you’ve to do is to download a VR app onto the phone and slot it into the font of the Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing about the Google Cardboard is that it utilises the magnetic switch as a trigger. So while using an app, using the ‘button’ will allow you to interact the same way as you touch your phone’s screen. As compared to other VR devices, such as the VR One, the magnetic switch is something exclusive to the Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many apps such as the Cardboard app (which allows you to watch movies, use Google Earth etc.), VR Roller Coaster (which takes you on a ride through the roller coaster) and the apps are definitely growing in number in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality is definitely here to stay and it’s development excites me. It opens up many new and different possibilities that people have only dreamt of. We can start to enjoy experiences which previously required us to be physically present elsewhere. The nascent virtual reality is rapidly developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether virtual reality is good or bad, that depends. There will always be people who might use VR technologies to enjoy in the world they want, without any grasp of reality. But on the other hand, VR’s potential can surely bring quality and happiness to many lives. For now, let’s hope that VR will bring us a more enjoyable future in the coming years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#images&quot;&gt;Below&lt;/a&gt; are pictures of the Google Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Clean & Green Hackathon 2015</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Clean-&-Green-Hackathon"/>
   <updated>2015-06-22T00:00:00+08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cgs.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/For-Event-Subpages.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image Credits: http://www.cgs.sg/events/calendar/hackathon/workshop/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Clean &amp;amp; Green Hackathon this weekend. This is second hackathon I participated in after Gamecraft (Organised by NUS Games Development Group) last year. It was particularly a very enriching experience. Held on a larger scale (nation-wide) and open to all ideas and hacks (including hardware, software, apps, games etc.) and people from all age groups, I was able to understand what to expect in a hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a continuous 24 hours hackathon, we were allowed to go home and return the next morning. It took place over a period of 3 days, starting from Friday (Ideation and pitching) till Sunday (when the judging and prize presentation was held).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know many people from different backgrounds and learn a lot from their ideas as well. Some were just there for the pure fun of it, to exchange ideas and make good friends. Some ideas were just excellent and gave me many new insights into further development of my own idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, my team (Kenny, Yong Zhi &amp;amp; myself) came up with the idea of a web &amp;amp; mobile ready platform called “The Greenlist”. It is basically a peer-to-peer connecting app where one can post his/her old items (eg: laptops, handphones, toys, books, furniture etc.) up for donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who needs this item but are willing to have it secondhand (and for free) can simply claim this item, and thereafter proceed to collect the item from the donor themselves. Each successful donation earns the donor some reward points which can then be redeemed for vouchers. To fund the operating costs (which are minimal), we proposed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-App Advertising&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-App Purchases (Eco-friendly items etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sponsorship for vouchers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Optional donation before claiming an item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the idea was formed, we made a prototype both for the web and mobile platform (using Justinmind software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, as the group leader, I made the pitch for our idea and gave a demo of our prototype. Given only 3 minutes for the pitch, it was crucial to make the most out of each and every second to create an everlasting impression of the idea &amp;amp; product/service. Though nervous, having take some public speaking training and course in NUS allowed me to focus on the pitch and do my best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the learning points was that I realised that I might have focused too much on the demo of the prototype itself. I should have instead allocated a major part towards helping the audience understand and appreciate the relevance and usefulness of the app in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the idea is crucial in a hackathon (even more than the prototype)! An effective idea will definitely win people over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, my team did not win, we were thankful for the experience. This hackathon gave me some crucial experience that will help me do better in the forthcoming hackathons I will be participating.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NUS First Year | Second Semester in Review</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/NUS-First-Year,-Semester-2-in-Review"/>
   <updated>2015-06-04T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NUS First Year, Semester 2 in Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following post is also available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/&quot;&gt;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long freshman year and I am surprised I am already writing a review for my 2nd semester at NUS. Semester 2 was much tougher than Semester 1, but ironically my grades were slightly better (yes, I can’t believe it too!).Thanks to the bell curve I suppose. Anyway, here is the module review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CG1108: Electrical Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good module that introduces the basic concepts of electrical engineering. I found the pace of the lectures very manageable compared to other modules. The total number of chapters covered is actually not a lot, and hence it allows you enough time to fully comprehend and grasp the basic concepts before moving onto the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lecturer for this module was Dr Sahoo. He is a very approachable lecturer and teaches very well. I find it important to attend his lectures (never missed any) since most of the working and examples are done in the lecture itself. Though the slides with the digitally written solutions are uploaded, it is much easier to follow through the lecture and examples in real time rather than at home where you have to figure them out all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment of the module is shared equally between the hands-on segment and the theory section. Hands-on segment includes the labs (10% attendance and 10% lab test) and the exciting Arduino car project (25%). Labs are manageable and you will be guided by your group’s assigned mentor. The lab test is very similar to whatever content you have learnt during the practical labs and make sure to watch the equipment briefing video uploaded by the ECE department to have a complete knowledge of the equipment and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car project was what many of us were looking forward to. There was a lot of time given for us to work on the car project. It is of high importance that you select your groupmates carefully. They must appreciate your suggestions and be willing to help each other out and put in a good amount of effort to work together and achieve the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did not like about the car project was the lack of constant results. The car basically takes input from the light-dependent resistors (LDR) and these resistors are very sensitive to the ambient light which makes it difficult to get consistent results. Nevertheless, I think the car project was one of the most exciting parts of the module. I still remember my friends’ and my reaction when our car worked for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory section includes the mid-term test (10%) and final exam (40%). Both exams were manageable and as long as the basic concepts and application has been mastered it should not be a problem to score well. For the final exam, practising past year papers is crucial in understanding the type of questions to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GEK1549: Critical Thinking and Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEK1549 was quite enjoyable. Like many, I did not like this module initially, but as time went, I began appreciating what was being taught. It is very systematic and really probes your thinking. The theme for our batch was on “Sustainable Cities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no lectures, only tutorials. My tutor was Dr Sadorra. She is really nice and approachable and gave me and my teammates very constructive comments and suggestions during the course of the module. She also prepares her own slides and provides good external references to clarify concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is divided into 3 parts. Assignment 1 (30%) requires the submission of a graphic organiser, summary and evaluation of a given article. Assignment 2 (30%) is a position paper that is done in groups. And Assignment 3 (10%) is essentially class participation. The other 30% comes from the final exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to do particularly well in both Assignments 1 &amp;amp; 2 and made effort to participate in class as much as possible. I felt the final exam was doable, but I was restricted due to the lack of time. Make sure you have good teammates for Assignment 2. Always have a clear foundation and roadmap as to what you will be doing for the position paper. In my case, for the problem-solution paper, I made sure that the problem and solutions are clearly linked. And to make our paper stand out, my teammates and I ensured that the proposed solutions were specific to the city and are feasible in the implmentation. Not an easy task, but you’ll get there after some considerable time into research and analysis. Be sure to utilise NUS Libraries website. The resources there will surely aid in obtaining reliable sources for the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a very manageable module, provided you put in good effort in understanding the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1020: Data Structures and Algorithms I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my favourite module of this semester due to my personal interest in computer programming. But, this was definitely not a easy module. The content covered were heavy and it requires a lot of practise and understanding to get used to the concepts taught. And before you are familar with one concept another concept will be taught. It requires discipline and effort to do some programming and to study for the module daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecturers for this module are Mr Aaron Tan and Dr Low. Both lecturers are very good in terms of teaching new concepts. They give plenty of examples to ensure our understanding is complete. It is important to attend and understand tutorials. Even when I couldn’t do or finish a particular tutorial, I made it a point to attend classes to ensure I do not neglect the tutorial. It kept me on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment for the module was divided into many parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tutorial Attendance/Participation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lab Attendance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Take-Home Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sit-in Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mid-term Test&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Final Exam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least you can do is to secure the marks from tutorial/lab attendance and take-home labs. This is greatly help in achieving a good grade. Take-home labs are often challenging, but you will given at least a week before the submission. Hence, ensure that you are able to solve these labs. Else, seek help during the lab sessions. The tutors are really helpful when you ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fast paced module. On any given week, you will most probably either have a sit-in lab or a take-home lab due. Consistent work and practice is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam was slightly tough for me. I realised I have made many careless mistakes after completing the exam. Otherwise, the difficulty of the questions asked were similar to those in tutorials. Focus on important topics such as recursion, hashing, sorting etc. These are major concepts that have a higher probability of being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a tough and fast paced module that definitely requires more effort than what you normally put in for a 4MC module. Discipline to revise and practice questions (on Codecrunch) on a regular basis is important from the start of the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my codes are hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/portfolio/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheet for final exam is now hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obbzVJUTBXWFIzVkk/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Please do write your own, this is only for reference, not reproduction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Tough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PC1432: Physics IIE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the toughest module for me. The rate at which chapters and concepts were covered was astonishing. I could barely keep up with the pace and was lost even before the recess week. It did not help that many of the chapters were inter-linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 3 lecturers. All of them were engaging and taught really well. But, it required a lot of effort from my side to fully grasp what they were saying and taking time to practice extra questions outside the tutorials. The questions from the tutorials are NOT enough as practice. The recommended textbook was really helpful for me to get a better understanding of the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment was divided into practical viva/reports (10%), online assignment from Mastering Physics (10%), mid-term test (20%) and final exam (60%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you do your best for the practicals and online assignments as these are relatively easier to score. The mid-term was manageable except for the time restriction. Planning your time during the examination is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the final exam very hard and was afraid I did not do as well as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a fast-paced and tough module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Very Hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MA1506: Mathematics II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MA1506 was much more manageable than MA1505, which I took in semester 1. This module covers a great depth into Differential Equations and linear algebra, linear transformations and Laplace transforms. Many of these concepts are crucial for engineering students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is divided into mid-term test (20%) and final exam (80%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part involving differential equations (DE) was fairly manageable and was even fun when modelling systems. All it requires is a good understanding of the various ways to solve DEs which can be achieved with sufficient practice from tutorials. The mid-term test was fully MCQ (10 questions in one hour) and was quite easy. I was able to score full marks for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After recess week, the pace of lectures started to increase together with the difficulty of concepts. Webcasted lectures were really helpful when I was revising to clarify my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exam was manageable. Make sure you have sufficient practice form the past year papers (check NUS Library website or IVLE). Since there are solutions provided, it helps to understand the structure of the questions. Questions are usually similar year to year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the help sheet (2 sides of 1 A4 sheet) is well prepared. You can see my help sheets &lt;a title=&quot;MA1505 &amp;amp; MA1506 Help Sheets&quot; href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/ma1505-ma1506-help-sheets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here for reference&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&quot;MA1505/MA1506 Helpsheets&quot; href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/nus/2015/05/26/MA1505%20&amp;amp;%20MA1506%20Help%20Sheets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a manageable module, provided sufficient effort is put in to understand fundamental concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Manageable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope the above reviews and tips were helpful! Comments are welcome (use the Disqus thread below).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NUS First Year, Second Semester in Review</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/NUS-First-Year,-Semester-2-in-Review"/>
   <updated>2015-06-04T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NUS First Year, Semester 2 in Review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following post is also available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/&quot;&gt;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a long freshman year and I am surprised I am already writing a review for my 2nd semester at NUS. Semester 2 was much tougher than Semester 1, but ironically my grades were slightly better (yes, I can’t believe it too!).Thanks to the bell curve I suppose. Anyway, here is the module review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CG1108: Electrical Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good module that introduces the basic concepts of electrical engineering. I found the pace of the lectures very manageable compared to other modules. The total number of chapters covered is actually not a lot, and hence it allows you enough time to fully comprehend and grasp the basic concepts before moving onto the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lecturer for this module was Dr Sahoo. He is a very approachable lecturer and teaches very well. I find it important to attend his lectures (never missed any) since most of the working and examples are done in the lecture itself. Though the slides with the digitally written solutions are uploaded, it is much easier to follow through the lecture and examples in real time rather than at home where you have to figure them out all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment of the module is shared equally between the hands-on segment and the theory section. Hands-on segment includes the labs (10% attendance and 10% lab test) and the exciting Arduino car project (25%). Labs are manageable and you will be guided by your group’s assigned mentor. The lab test is very similar to whatever content you have learnt during the practical labs and make sure to watch the equipment briefing video uploaded by the ECE department to have a complete knowledge of the equipment and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car project was what many of us were looking forward to. There was a lot of time given for us to work on the car project. It is of high importance that you select your groupmates carefully. They must appreciate your suggestions and be willing to help each other out and put in a good amount of effort to work together and achieve the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did not like about the car project was the lack of constant results. The car basically takes input from the light-dependent resistors (LDR) and these resistors are very sensitive to the ambient light which makes it difficult to get consistent results. Nevertheless, I think the car project was one of the most exciting parts of the module. I still remember my friends’ and my reaction when our car worked for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory section includes the mid-term test (10%) and final exam (40%). Both exams were manageable and as long as the basic concepts and application has been mastered it should not be a problem to score well. For the final exam, practising past year papers is crucial in understanding the type of questions to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GEK1549: Critical Thinking and Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEK1549 was quite enjoyable. Like many, I did not like this module initially, but as time went, I began appreciating what was being taught. It is very systematic and really probes your thinking. The theme for our batch was on “Sustainable Cities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no lectures, only tutorials. My tutor was Dr Sadorra. She is really nice and approachable and gave me and my teammates very constructive comments and suggestions during the course of the module. She also prepares her own slides and provides good external references to clarify concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is divided into 3 parts. Assignment 1 (30%) requires the submission of a graphic organiser, summary and evaluation of a given article. Assignment 2 (30%) is a position paper that is done in groups. And Assignment 3 (10%) is essentially class participation. The other 30% comes from the final exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to do particularly well in both Assignments 1 &amp;amp; 2 and made effort to participate in class as much as possible. I felt the final exam was doable, but I was restricted due to the lack of time. Make sure you have good teammates for Assignment 2. Always have a clear foundation and roadmap as to what you will be doing for the position paper. In my case, for the problem-solution paper, I made sure that the problem and solutions are clearly linked. And to make our paper stand out, my teammates and I ensured that the proposed solutions were specific to the city and are feasible in the implmentation. Not an easy task, but you’ll get there after some considerable time into research and analysis. Be sure to utilise NUS Libraries website. The resources there will surely aid in obtaining reliable sources for the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a very manageable module, provided you put in good effort in understanding the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Take-Home Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sit-in Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mid-term Test&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Final Exam&lt;/td&gt;

   <title>NOC Interview (Round 1)</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/NOC-Interview-Round-1"/>
   <updated>2015-05-25T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NOC Interview Round 1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went for the NOC interview a few weeks back, just before my final examinations for semester 2. As it was mentioned in the confirmatione email, it was agroup interview indeed. My session was on the morning of Thursday and had about 8 people including me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were divided into 2 groups and given a hypothetical situation to discuss upon. In my case, we were given 2 simple business models (not as complex as you think) and then we had to discuss which business model will be more successful in the long run. The interviewers were very friendly and approachable. It is crucial to note that the interviewers are NOT looking for a correct answer. In fact, there is no right or wrong answer and it depends entirely upon how you feel. As long as you and your groupmates agree upon a common model and explain in as much detail as possible why it is the better one, you would have done your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such group interview situations, the best way to make an impression is to try and lead the discussion from the start, which I did. So, instead of sitting around and looking at each other in awkward silence, initate the discussion and the overview. It was a good thing that all members of my team agreed uniformly on the model I had in mind. Then, immediately after settling the main topic of discussion, I tried to model the scope of the discussion by listing out the relevant factors to the topic. After which, I decided on the factors I will be presenting and the subsequent allocation of the other factors for my group members to present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the presentation went very well and at the end of the discussion it seemed that the interviewers did agree with our choice of model. I was happy to receive the news that I have successfully passed the first stage of the selection and am current anticipating the second round of interview coming soon in August/September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Points I learnt: &lt;/strong&gt;
You are being noted once you step into the interview room. Everything that you say and do will have an impact on the impression the interviewers have on you.
Learn to be concise. It’s not necessary to talk as much as possible to show that you are good. Being concise will show that you have a clear mind and are focused on what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NOC Interview Round 1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went for the NOC interview a few weeks back, just before my final examinations for semester 2. As it was mentioned in the confirmatione email, it was agroup interview indeed. My session was on the morning of Thursday and had about 8 people including me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were divided into 2 groups and given a hypothetical situation to discuss upon. In my case, we were given 2 simple business models (not as complex as you think) and then we had to discuss which business model will be more successful in the long run. The interviewers were very friendly and approachable. It is crucial to note that the interviewers are NOT looking for a correct answer. In fact, there is no right or wrong answer and it depends entirely upon how you feel. As long as you and your groupmates agree upon a common model and explain in as much detail as possible why it is the better one, you would have done your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such group interview situations, the best way to make an impression is to try and lead the discussion from the start, which I did. So, instead of sitting around and looking at each other in awkward silence, initate the discussion and the overview. It was a good thing that all members of my team agreed uniformly on the model I had in mind. Then, immediately after settling the main topic of discussion, I tried to model the scope of the discussion by listing out the relevant factors to the topic. After which, I decided on the factors I will be presenting and the subsequent allocation of the other factors for my group members to present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the presentation went very well and at the end of the discussion it seemed that the interviewers did agree with our choice of model. I was happy to receive the news that I have successfully passed the first stage of the selection and am current anticipating the second round of interview coming soon in August/September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Points I learnt: &lt;/strong&gt;
You are being noted once you step into the interview room. Everything that you say and do will have an impact on the impression the interviewers have on you.
Learn to be concise. It’s not necessary to talk as much as possible to show that you are good. Being concise will show that you have a clear mind and are focused on what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a hectic semester! Seems like the last time I blogged was before my semester. In NUS they always say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The only easy semester was the last semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it might be true. I was a little confident that the first semester would have helped me to adjust to the environment and that the second semester will be much easier to cope. Though I have gotten used to the environment, the workload is definitely on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is extremely hard to achieve a work-life balance as there is a lot of pressure to give your best. I realise that I can achieve well when I really appreciate and love what I am learning instead of going through the motion of education at college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully summer is finally here and I hope to get a good break. I have a lot of mini projects to accomplish this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the projects will be Friendezvous, which I am doing for a “module” called Orbital. Please do support me by liking the Facebook page &lt;a href=&quot;www.fb.com/ProjectFriendezvous&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My module reviews for the previous semester are on their way! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till then,&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-140&quot; src=&quot;https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/uni6.gif?w=250&quot; alt=&quot;https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Image Credits: https://helenmagnani.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was reading The Lost Symbol, by Dan Brown, there was an interesting idea shared which immediately awed me. It deals with the hypothetical question: “Do thoughts have mass?”. Though, on a weighing scale, thoughts may possess mass ranging in the nano to femto scale, if they do have a mass, there will be many implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which was presented in the book was on gravity. If our thoughts had some mass, they will be bound by the laws of physics. Which meant, they will exert a gravitational force on other matter (though the force is of a very very small scale). Despite the insignificant amount force by a single thought, when a group of people come together to think on the same idea, this collective force becomes significant. It might then start to attract others towards this idea or notion. And that, will be powerful, when a thought can attract others and influence them to think in a certain way too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is a hypothetical question, the implications simply awed me. Upon further thinking: With thoughts having some mass, they will also be bounded by the Law of Conservation of Energy. Thoughts cannot be destroyed entirely. Instead, the thoughts are simply converted from one thought/idea to another. Or, they may become converted into another form of energy (likely chemical energy) in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is fascinating to imagine the implications if such a hypothesis was proven to be real. Whether it is true if thoughts have mass or not, only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of my favourite quotes on the power of thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Change your thoughts and you change your world. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Norman Vincent Peale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swami Vivekananda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Graham Bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results. &lt;br /&gt;

   <title>NUS Gradeless First Semester</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/NUS-Gradeless-First-Sem"/>
   <updated>2014-12-29T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//NUS Gradeless First Sem</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NUS has introduced gradeless first semester since AY2014/15. And I am from AY14/15 batch. Though gradeless semester seems enticing, there’s really more to it. There are some conditions and pointers to take note which will leave you confused if you’re not used to the NUS system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to know: NUS utilises the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) to determine the performance of a student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formula for determining CAP: &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-126&quot; src=&quot;https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screen-shot-2014-12-24-at-1-29-19-pm.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-12-24 at 1.29.19 pm&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the numerator is the sum of the product of module credits and grade points and the denominator is the sum of the module credits for ALL the modules taken so far. It’s crucial to note the cumulative function of the CAP. Hence, it is not determined on a per semester basis, but rather for the 3-4 years of modules taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximise the S/U options given during the gradeless semester, there are some things to note first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the class of degree you&#39;re aiming for.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degrees awarded are classified as shown (taken from NUS website):
&lt;table border=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honours Degree Classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Highest Distinction)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CAP 4.50 and above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Distinction)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.0 to 4.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Merit)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.5 to 3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.0 to 3.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pass&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.0 to 2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Below 2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Note the Grade Point table:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letter Grades:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;C+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the target is Honours (Highest Distinction), then a CAP of 4.50 and above is required by the end of your 3-4 years. To achieve this, the average grade for the modules you took for 4 years must be at least an A-.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, during the S/U option, S/U anything below A- is a good option, since it will increase the number of modules with grades A- and above&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first semester is a good indication of the performance for the rest of the semesters, then S/Uing any modules with a gradepoint below your CAP is a good idea. For example, your CAP is 4.44, and your grades are A,A-, A,B+,B+, then S/U modules below 4.44 which are the 2 B+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gradepoints allocated to the grades, for example 4.0 for a B+ means it will pull your overall CAP towards the 4.0. Hence, unless the overall CAP is below 4.0, then B+ would not really help with pushing the CAP upwards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>NUS First Year | First Semester in Review</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s has been a great semester. Well, it was stressful, but it was particularly fulfilling. University life is exciting as I get to learn what I am most passionate about. The gradeless semester is another point that allowed me to read the modules without worrying too much about grades. Nevertheless, I was never aiming to SU any modules. Here is a quick review of the modules I took in Semester 1. All of them are pre-allocated since I am a Computer Engineering student, except the GEM I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CG1001: Introduction to Computer Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this module sums it up all. This module is meant to provide an overview of Computer Engineering for freshmen and allow them to have a clear understanding of what areas they can specialise in during their senior years. Basically, the workload is not much. &lt;br /&gt;
I was tasked with 2 reports (based on the specialisation areas in Computer Engineering) and a project video. The reports are 25% each and the video is 50%. Reports are done in pairs (randomly grouped by the professor). Similarly, for the project video, you will be assigned a group of four randomly. Then you have present a video (about 5 mins long) which presents the topic chosen in a creative and informative way. My group chose the topic on 4G LTE networks. We personally did it in the form of an advertisement and incorporated animation to make the video more interactive. This module is meant to help you pull up your CAP (though it is only 2 MCs). Give it your best, especially for the reports. Be creative and analytical when discussing the selected topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade I obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Very much delighted to have obtained an A. I had really given my best for the reports and the video (especially the animation and planning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1010: Programming Methodolody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my most favourite module of this semester. I have no experience programming in C language. However, I was familiar with other languages like Python, Javascript and HTML. I personally like programming very much. The natural interest motivated me to do my best for this module. However, do not worry if you have no previous programming experience. Make sure you start learning the basics well, and do one practice task per day (there’s plenty of tasks on the CS1010 website). My lecturer was Mr Gary Tan. He is one amazing lecturer. He makes learning enjoyable and he is really funny. I am really happy to learn under him. He offered us a lot of help (separate group discussions and marking my past-year CS1010 papers I did for practice). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lectures are taught in a flipped-classroom method. You are expected to revise the slides and notes before the lectures (held in computer labs). This is very important indeed. Despite the long lecture, it’s not enough to cover all the concepts thoroughly. It requires many hours of practise to get the programming concepts and fluency expected of you. The module grading is broken up into 2 practical exams (10%, 25%), 1 mid-term test (15%), take home lab assignments (5%), attendance (5%) and the final exam (40%). I did not do well for the 2 practical exams. The first one was especially bad. Though I had good practice, the exam stress itself and the pressure under time restrictions made me panic. As a result, I was not able to complete the 2 tasks on time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake was that I focused on code logic and clarity, thinking that these criteria were also awarded significant marks. However, only after the exam did I know that close to 60% will be awarded for the correct output. Hence, focus on obtaining the right output. Your code may be inefficient, but it is your output that is being considered. Therefore, note that you are being awarded the marks for your ability to complete the task. The take home lab assignments are quite challenging. Try your best to complete it during the weekends. Last-minute stress is never good. Consult your friends and lecturers if you do not know how to do them. Lastly, and most importantly, finish the task within the suggested time limit (comes in helpful for the practical exams). Attendance and the lab marks (5% each) are really a giveaway for this module. Utilise it well and don’t skip tutorials unless you have a valid MC. The final exam was quite easy for me, except for one question. I guess it helped me to make up for the practical exams which I did not do as expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade for CS1010: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly very happy with A-. Being my favourite module, I had really wanted an A+. But the practical exams pulled my overall grade down. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1231: Discrete Structures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally did not like this module when I first started. But as it progressed, I began to appreciate this module. It provides a different view to common concepts. You learn to prove everything. For example, you learn to prove that an even number plus another even number is even. Such seemingly simple things which we just assume to be true must be proven. One of the coolest things you’ll learn is to prove that 1+1 = 2. Well, if before this module, someone asked me to prove that I would have been stunned. But now, I do have an answer that proves this to be true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecturers for the module were Prof Stephen Bressan and Prof Bryan Low. Both of them were good. Prof Stephen likes to ask interesting questions on the topic and invites your opinions and answers. But he does cover the chapters very quickly (especially the proofs). Prof Bryan Low was good too. He actually goes through every proof that is in his notes and makes sure that you understand it clearly. Both lecturers are really approachable. Make sure to clear your doubts immediately after the lecture (before you forget them). That being said, this module is really demanding as the pace of the lectures is extremely fast. The tutorials are really crucial for you to grasp the application of the concepts learnt during lectures to the questions in your tutorials. Personal advice: Do NOT skip the tutorials. The recommended textbook is Discrete Mathematics Demystified. I found it barely enough to understand all the concepts taught. Nevertheless, it helped me greatly to comprehend the basic concepts in each chapter. For challenging exercises, see past year questions or ask your tutor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is graded based on a video project, a mid-term test and the final exam. As for the video project, my team focused on exploring the game of Tic Tac Toe. The video has been embed here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mo1_F806J_I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video project is meant to help you to pull your grade up. Do give your best in terms of analysing and presenting the chosen topic. The mid-term test was quite easy and the final exam was moderately difficult. Some questions only required common sense, while others really tested the concepts and formulas you’ve been taught. All in all, a content-heavy module that can be done well with consistent practise and dedication to learning the concepts well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really happy with the grade as I did not expect it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GEM2027: Public Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to choose to do a SS/GEM/breadth module in the first semester. Public speaking was the only module that fitted my timetable and the skill itself seemed really useful. Plus a bonus was that there were no exams. Of course, instead of the final exam, you will be graded on some of the speeches and there will be a module quiz at the end as well as a video project to be delivered. Lecturer for the module is Ms Cardoza. She is a very good lecturer and I like her enthusiasm in each lecture. She is very approachable (both personally and on forums) and encouraged me to give my best in my speeches. The lectures basically introduces some tips and pointers for effective public speaking. Some are really common sense, but the thing is that many of us fail to follow them. We need to remember simple things like body language (eg: do not put your hands in your pockets) and tone which will be critiqued by your tutor. Such seemingly simple pointers will be reinforced again and again throughout the module. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graded speeches are Informative (15%), Persuasive (20%) and Responders-Critique (15%). The other 50% is for the quiz and video. While there was plenty of time given for each speech, personally it really took up loads of time to prepare a good speech. It wasn’t as easy as writing the speech alone. Firstly, the speech category is broad. Hence, you will naturally spend quite a bit of time thinking on which topic you should speak about. Second, the preparation requires hours of research and analysis to support your points (any claim you make must be supported to establish your credibility to the audience). Third, you need to make your speech interesting, add some funny elements etc. Fourth, you need to practise again and again to ensure good body language and fluency of your speech. Fifth, if visual aids like PowerPoint is being used, you need to create the slides and practise controlling the slides. As you see, you need many hours of preparation before each speech. I usually use up my whole weekend doing the above. It wasn’t helpful that all my modules had tight deadlines to meet. Of course, if you’re someone who can manage your time easily or have prior experience in public speaking, this comes easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor is that the marks awarded for the speeches largely depend on how strict is your tutor is. Well, my tutor did have very high expectations since he speaks frequently at events and has a lot of experience in public speaking. Naturally, he expected a much more. Hence, the grade you get depends very much on your tutor too! Nevertheless, give your best and you will get what you deserve. The video project was really fun! We were free to do any video to express the ideas we have learnt in the course. My group created a comic-book type of video that is presented in terms of a storyboard. I enjoyed the project. Since it is due near the last week of the semester, you will barely have time to meet up for the project. Another downside was that my team members were all from different years of study (all of them were in Year 4 and from different faculties/majors). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it was almost impossible to get a time-slot to meet and discuss. We had to do it right away after class. Surprisingly, our video got shortlisted as one of the top ten! But we did not win the top prize though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the video &lt;a title=&quot;Public Speaking - No Longer Clarkie&#39;s Kryptonite! &quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOZsQ18Ufhs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hOZsQ18Ufhs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Always take a topic you are well knowledgeable about and confident with.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to be clear of the structure of your entire speech before deciding on it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It may help to write out the entire speech and then do the Preparation Outline (PO). All you would need to do is to copy and paste the relevant sections from the speech into the PO (with some rephrases, of course).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to buy a clicker to control the PowerPoint slides when presenting, or ask your close friend to lend you one (like I did).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creativity is greatly rewarded in this module. Especially for your video project, presenting the learning points in a creative manner can help you achieve good marks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very satisfied with this grade. I expected an A-. Nevertheless, I am sure I have given my best for this module. Public speaking is a skill you have keep developing anyway. Overall, it was a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MA1505: Mathematics I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many concepts you need to understand for this module. Whenever you have free time, learn to utilise it to revise the upcoming topics. Though the lectures are nicely-paced, the amount of concepts to grasp requires quite some time. The last few topics (line and surface integrals may be difficult to grasp). The module is graded with a mid-term test (20%) and the final exam (80%). My lecturer for this module was Prof Leung Pui Fai (Fred). He is a very good lecturer. He takes the time to explain concepts very patiently. He is also very approachable. Make sure to pay good attention during the lectures. If you find the pace slow or you missed the lecture then you can always use the webcast on IVLE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial topics revolve around the ‘A’ level content such as differentiation, integration, functions, vectors etc. Hence, you might not need much time to grasp these concepts. However, for other topics like line integrals and surface integrals, you must be able to visualise what the formula you are using actually means. Everything you do will involved 3D manipulation. So, you have to visualise in 3D as well. This is the hardest part. Initially, I was a little lax about practise since I was able to do all the tutorial questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-term test was an eye-opener. The questions really test your understanding and are tricky. Mid-term questions are tricky and requires good thinking and speed to complete on time. Make sure to practise all the past-year papers which are available at IVLE and NUS e-library. It is a tough module, but with consistent practise you can do well. The one A4 paper (2-sided) cheat sheet really helps! Make sure to prepare your cheat sheet well. Ensure it is comprehensive and note that they are strict with the term “2-sided A4 sheet”. Only use a single A4 white paper to write notes on both sides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have done better (especially in the MCQ mid-term test), but a B+ is not too bad I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a good semester. Despite the 3 video projects (video projects really take up a lot of time!), I learnt a lot through the term. I could have done better in MA1505 and CS1010, but it is all in the learning experience to not repeat your mistakes. Most importantly, I have learned to manage my time better and study for the love of learning. Not just for the grades. Looking forward to the next semester. Till then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!&lt;/p&gt;

Very much delighted to have obtained an A. I had really given my best for the reports and the video (especially the animation and planning).&lt;/p&gt;

He offered us a lot of help (separate group discussions and marking my past-year CS1010 papers I did for practice). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lectures are taught in a flipped-classroom method. You are expected to revise the slides and notes before the lectures (held in computer labs). This is very important indeed. Despite the long lecture, it’s not enough to cover all the concepts thoroughly. It requires many hours of practise to get the programming concepts and fluency expected of you. The module grading is broken up into 2 practical exams (10%, 25%), 1 mid-term test (15%), take home lab assignments (5%), attendance (5%) and the final exam (40%).

&lt;h2&gt;GEM2027: Public Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to choose to do a SS/GEM/breadth module in the first semester. Public speaking was the only module that fitted my timetable and the skill itself seemed really useful. Plus a bonus was that there were no exams. Of course, instead of the final exam, you will be graded on some of the speeches and there will be a module quiz at the end as well as a video project to be delivered.

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it was almost impossible to get a time-slot to meet and discuss. We had to do it right away after class. Surprisingly, our video got shortlisted as one of the top ten! But we did not win the top prize though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the video &lt;a title=&quot;Public Speaking - No Longer Clarkie&#39;s Kryptonite! &quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOZsQ18Ufhs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Try to buy a clicker to control the PowerPoint slides when presenting, or ask your close friend to lend you one (like I did).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creativity is greatly rewarded in this module. Especially for your video project, presenting the learning points in a creative manner can help you achieve good marks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very satisfied with this grade. I expected an A-. Nevertheless, I am sure I have given my best for this module. Public speaking is a skill you have keep developing anyway. Overall, it was a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MA1505: Mathematics I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many concepts you need to understand for this module. Whenever you have free time, learn to utilise it to revise the upcoming topics. Though the lectures are nicely-paced, the amount of concepts to grasp requires quite some time. The last few topics (line and surface integrals may be difficult to grasp). The module is graded with a mid-term test (20%) and the final exam (80%). My lecturer for this module was Prof Leung Pui Fai (Fred). He is a very good lecturer. He takes the time to explain concepts very patiently. He is also very approachable. Make sure to pay good attention during the lectures. If you find the pace slow or you missed the lecture then you can always use the webcast on IVLE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial topics revolve around the ‘A’ level content such as differentiation, integration, functions, vectors etc. Hence, you might not need much time to grasp these concepts. However, for other topics like line integrals and surface integrals, you must be able to visualise what the formula you are using actually means. Everything you do will involved 3D manipulation. So, you have to visualise in 3D as well. This is the hardest part. Initially, I was a little lax about practise since I was able to do all the tutorial questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-term test was an eye-opener. The questions really test your understanding and are tricky. Mid-term questions are tricky and requires good thinking and speed to complete on time. Make sure to practise all the past-year papers which are available at IVLE and NUS e-library. It is a tough module, but with consistent practise you can do well. The one A4 paper (2-sided) cheat sheet really helps! Make sure to prepare your cheat sheet well. Ensure it is comprehensive and note that they are strict with the term “2-sided A4 sheet”. Only use a single A4 white paper to write notes on both sides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have done better (especially in the MCQ mid-term test), but a B+ is not too bad I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a good semester. Despite the 3 video projects (video projects really take up a lot of time!), I learnt a lot through the term. I could have done better in MA1505 and CS1010, but it is all in the learning experience to not repeat your mistakes. Most importantly, I have learned to manage my time better and study for the love of learning. Not just for the grades. Looking forward to the next semester. Till then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Most Powerful Thing in the World</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/Most-Powerful-Thing-in-the-World"/>
   <updated>2014-12-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//Most Powerful Thing in the World</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what is the most powerful thing in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, its not money, not wealth, maybe love, but really I think its an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, an idea. Every single day, we see ideas that change and craft the world. From the phone in your hand to the computer you’re reading this blog on, every thing around us took root from the idea that came up in someone’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you think about it, an idea isn’t something tangible. Not any physical product you can touch and understand. Nevertheless, you can feel it. And if an idea is powerful enough, it can change the world for the better, or for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly felt galvanised watching Inception. Inception is basically about implanting someone else’s idea into a target’s subconscious, deep enough, that it changes their way of thinking. Well, an idea seems like a simple thing. But the potential and the potency of an idea goes beyond itself. It creates a chain reaction so complex that without that single idea in a person’s brain, the world might have been different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea right now, in your head is something so powerful. Make sure it is put to good use. To make a change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you really want something, all the Universe conspires in helping you achieve it. -The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote I always remember. What you are, who you are is defined by your ideas, your actions. If you have a good idea, and truly believe in it, then give it your best shot. Make your ideas come alive.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I need an Internship!!</title>

   <updated>2014-12-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//I need an Internship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every computer engineer who is passionate about what he does will want to create or inspire a change that makes a difference in this world. Many a times, these inspirations, to even start, does not come from just pure academics, but rather from the practical experiences we gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across the this post which shows the best places where we can develop ourselves and get the inspiration we have always been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed on Business Insider, the top tech internships are offered by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google
Qualcomm
Microsoft
Intel
Cisco
IBM
Amazon
Apparently, the interview difficulty in getting the internship increases as we climb the list. Well, at the same time the salary increases (ranges between $5k – 6k) too. So you get what you work for despite the stiff competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is not only the best tech giants that can provide good internships. A good internship is one where we can learn to the fullest, about the process of not only creating ideas, but implementing it into a practical solution that yields tangible and visible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place where we can get such an experience will definitely be the start-up sectors. Here is where true entrepreneurship flourishes. Here is where we can learn the nitty gritty details of kicking off from the ground, to flying the plane, and landing at the destination. And here is where, you learn to unveil the entrepreneur in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aminariana.com/essays/ultimate-internship&quot;&gt;Related article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the unconventional path to do the greater good in the world. Where’s the fun when everyone wants to the conventional things in life. Risk-taking and courage are truly the qualities of the successful leaders we see today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small quote from Apple:

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently took part in Gamecraft 2014, organised by NUS Games Development Group (GDG). My first so-called “hackathon” experience. Glad to have worked with great teammates, Alvian, Chris &amp;amp; Tio. Learnt a lot from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the given 24 hours and under the theme of “Contact”, we had to design and build a working game! This was a tough task, since we had to ideate within a short span of time and build a working prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some of my teammates had prior experience with platforms such as Gamemaker and Unity which allowed us to have a clear vision of how exactly are we going to execute our gameplan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the link to final copy of the 2D game, titled “ConTag”, which also won us the 2nd Prize in Gamecraft 2014!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Division 2&lt;/td&gt;  
&lt;td&gt;Division 3&lt;/td&gt;  
&lt;/tr&gt;  
&lt;/tbody&gt;  
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preformattedtext&quot;&gt;Preformatted Text&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typographically, preformatted text is not the same thing as code. Sometimes, a faithful execution of the text requires preformatted text that may not have anything to do with code. Most browsers use Courier and that’s a good default — with one slight adjustment, Courier 10 Pitch over regular Courier for Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code can be presented inline, like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php bloginfo(&#39;stylesheet_url&#39;); ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or within a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; block. Because we have more specific typographic needs for code, we’ll specify Consolas and Monaco ahead of the browser-defined monospace font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code blocks can also be inserted with the highlight tag as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    
    {% highlight language-x %}
    # some code
    {% endhighlight %}
    
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about code highlighting in jekyll can be found  &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting&quot;&gt;in Jekyll documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These area a couple of examples showing the resulting highlighted code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* css code sample */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;-240px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockquotes&quot;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text. Be sure to style the citation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you’d like to hear it I can sing it for you. &lt;cite&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000&quot;&gt;HAL 9000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Businessman & the fisherman</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/the-businessman-and-fisherman"/>
   <updated>2014-08-12T18:18:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//the-businessman-and-fisherman</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But what then, señor?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Have a Dream</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/i-have-a-dream"/>

   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//i-have-a-dream</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot walk alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free at last! Free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Purpose of Education</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/the-purpose-of-education"/>
   <updated>1948-12-12T17:48:00+07:30</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//the-purpose-of-education</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Out to Sea</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/out-to-sea"/>
   <updated>1912-07-24T17:18:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//out-to-sea</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man’s diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi. The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields–a strong, virile man –mentally, morally, and physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea–unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them–a belaying pin and a revolver–nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small–a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From scarlet the officer’s face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor’s heart lodged in the sailor’s leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain’s arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen’s mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared–England’s far-reaching navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the fellow’s tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Looking-Glass house</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/looking-glass-house"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief. 
The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. 
But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. ‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking! 
‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them! ‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. ‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’ But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’ 
‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. ‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her. 
‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’ Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. 
‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. ‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter. 
The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’ 
‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. ‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’ Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. 
So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. 
‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen. The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said. 
The King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’ 
To which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’ 
‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’ ‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’ Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. 
The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’ 
‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Down The Rabbit Hole</title>
   <link href="http://harishv.me/down-the-rabbit-hole"/>
   <updated>1865-11-26T17:48:00+07:30</updated>
   <id>http://harishv.me/blog//down-the-rabbit-hole</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
