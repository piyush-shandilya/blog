  <p>The following post is also available at: <a href="https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/">https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/nus-first-year-semester-2-in-review/</a> </p>

<hr />

<p>It has been a long freshman year and I am surprised I am already writing a review for my 2nd semester at NUS. Semester 2 was much tougher than Semester 1, but ironically my grades were slightly better (yes, I can’t believe it too!).Thanks to the bell curve I suppose. Anyway, here is the module review:</p>

<hr />

<h2>CG1108: Electrical Engineering</h2>

<p>A good module that introduces the basic concepts of electrical engineering. I found the pace of the lectures very manageable compared to other modules. The total number of chapters covered is actually not a lot, and hence it allows you enough time to fully comprehend and grasp the basic concepts before moving onto the next chapter.</p>

<p>My lecturer for this module was Dr Sahoo. He is a very approachable lecturer and teaches very well. I find it important to attend his lectures (never missed any) since most of the working and examples are done in the lecture itself. Though the slides with the digitally written solutions are uploaded, it is much easier to follow through the lecture and examples in real time rather than at home where you have to figure them out all by yourself.</p>

<p>The assessment of the module is shared equally between the hands-on segment and the theory section. Hands-on segment includes the labs (10% attendance and 10% lab test) and the exciting Arduino car project (25%). Labs are manageable and you will be guided by your group’s assigned mentor. The lab test is very similar to whatever content you have learnt during the practical labs and make sure to watch the equipment briefing video uploaded by the ECE department to have a complete knowledge of the equipment and how to use them.</p>

<p>The car project was what many of us were looking forward to. There was a lot of time given for us to work on the car project. It is of high importance that you select your groupmates carefully. They must appreciate your suggestions and be willing to help each other out and put in a good amount of effort to work together and achieve the target.</p>

<p>What I did not like about the car project was the lack of constant results. The car basically takes input from the light-dependent resistors (LDR) and these resistors are very sensitive to the ambient light which makes it difficult to get consistent results. Nevertheless, I think the car project was one of the most exciting parts of the module. I still remember my friends’ and my reaction when our car worked for the first time!</p>

<p>The theory section includes the mid-term test (10%) and final exam (40%). Both exams were manageable and as long as the basic concepts and application has been mastered it should not be a problem to score well. For the final exam, practising past year papers is crucial in understanding the type of questions to expect.</p>

<p>Grade obtained: <strong>A</strong> <br />
Difficulty: Average</p>

<hr />

<h2>GEK1549: Critical Thinking and Writing</h2>

<p>GEK1549 was quite enjoyable. Like many, I did not like this module initially, but as time went, I began appreciating what was being taught. It is very systematic and really probes your thinking. The theme for our batch was on “Sustainable Cities”.</p>

<p>There are no lectures, only tutorials. My tutor was Dr Sadorra. She is really nice and approachable and gave me and my teammates very constructive comments and suggestions during the course of the module. She also prepares her own slides and provides good external references to clarify concepts.</p>

<p>Assessment is divided into 3 parts. Assignment 1 (30%) requires the submission of a graphic organiser, summary and evaluation of a given article. Assignment 2 (30%) is a position paper that is done in groups. And Assignment 3 (10%) is essentially class participation. The other 30% comes from the final exam.</p>

<p>I was able to do particularly well in both Assignments 1 &amp; 2 and made effort to participate in class as much as possible. I felt the final exam was doable, but I was restricted due to the lack of time. Make sure you have good teammates for Assignment 2. Always have a clear foundation and roadmap as to what you will be doing for the position paper. In my case, for the problem-solution paper, I made sure that the problem and solutions are clearly linked. And to make our paper stand out, my teammates and I ensured that the proposed solutions were specific to the city and are feasible in the implmentation. Not an easy task, but you’ll get there after some considerable time into research and analysis. Be sure to utilise NUS Libraries website. The resources there will surely aid in obtaining reliable sources for the paper.</p>

<p>All in all a very manageable module, provided you put in good effort in understanding the tutorials.</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: <strong>A</strong> <br />
Difficulty: Average</p>

<hr />

<h2>CS1020: Data Structures and Algorithms I</h2>

<p>This was my favourite module of this semester due to my personal interest in computer programming. But, this was definitely not a easy module. The content covered were heavy and it requires a lot of practise and understanding to get used to the concepts taught. And before you are familar with one concept another concept will be taught. It requires discipline and effort to do some programming and to study for the module daily.</p>

<p>Lecturers for this module are Mr Aaron Tan and Dr Low. Both lecturers are very good in terms of teaching new concepts. They give plenty of examples to ensure our understanding is complete. It is important to attend and understand tutorials. Even when I couldn’t do or finish a particular tutorial, I made it a point to attend classes to ensure I do not neglect the tutorial. It kept me on track.</p>

<p>Assessment for the module was divided into many parts:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tutorial Attendance/Participation</td>
<td>7%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lab Attendance</td>
<td>3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Take-Home Labs</td>
<td>11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sit-in Labs</td>
<td>24%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mid-term Test</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final Exam</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The least you can do is to secure the marks from tutorial/lab attendance and take-home labs. This is greatly help in achieving a good grade. Take-home labs are often challenging, but you will given at least a week before the submission. Hence, ensure that you are able to solve these labs. Else, seek help during the lab sessions. The tutors are really helpful when you ask questions.</p>

<p>It’s a fast paced module. On any given week, you will most probably either have a sit-in lab or a take-home lab due. Consistent work and practice is of vital importance.</p>

<p>The final exam was slightly tough for me. I realised I have made many careless mistakes after completing the exam. Otherwise, the difficulty of the questions asked were similar to those in tutorials. Focus on important topics such as recursion, hashing, sorting etc. These are major concepts that have a higher probability of being tested.</p>

<p>All in all, a tough and fast paced module that definitely requires more effort than what you normally put in for a 4MC module. Discipline to revise and practice questions (on Codecrunch) on a regular basis is important from the start of the module.</p>

<p>Some of my codes are hosted <a href="http://harishv7.github.io/portfolio/">here</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/harishv7">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: <strong>A-</strong> <br />
Difficulty: Tough</p>

<hr />

<h2>PC1432: Physics IIE</h2>

<p>This was the toughest module for me. The rate at which chapters and concepts were covered was astonishing. I could barely keep up with the pace and was lost even before the recess week. It did not help that many of the chapters were inter-linked.</p>

<p>There were a total of 3 lecturers. All of them were engaging and taught really well. But, it required a lot of effort from my side to fully grasp what they were saying and taking time to practice extra questions outside the tutorials. The questions from the tutorials are NOT enough as practice. The recommended textbook was really helpful for me to get a better understanding of the concepts.</p>

<p>Assessment was divided into practical viva/reports (10%), online assignment from Mastering Physics (10%), mid-term test (20%) and final exam (60%).</p>

<p>Ensure that you do your best for the practicals and online assignments as these are relatively easier to score. The mid-term was manageable except for the time restriction. Planning your time during the examination is crucial.</p>

<p>I found the final exam very hard and was afraid I did not do as well as I expected.</p>

<p>All in all, a fast-paced and tough module.</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: <strong>A-</strong> <br />
Difficulty: Very Hard</p>

<hr />

<h2>MA1506: Mathematics II</h2>

<p>MA1506 was much more manageable than MA1505, which I took in semester 1. This module covers a great depth into Differential Equations and linear algebra, linear transformations and Laplace transforms. Many of these concepts are crucial for engineering students.</p>

<p>Assessment is divided into mid-term test (20%) and final exam (80%).</p>

<p>The first part involving differential equations (DE) was fairly manageable and was even fun when modelling systems. All it requires is a good understanding of the various ways to solve DEs which can be achieved with sufficient practice from tutorials. The mid-term test was fully MCQ (10 questions in one hour) and was quite easy. I was able to score full marks for this one.</p>

<p>After recess week, the pace of lectures started to increase together with the difficulty of concepts. Webcasted lectures were really helpful when I was revising to clarify my doubts.</p>

<p>Final exam was manageable. Make sure you have sufficient practice form the past year papers (check NUS Library website or IVLE). Since there are solutions provided, it helps to understand the structure of the questions. Questions are usually similar year to year.</p>

<p>Make sure the help sheet (2 sides of 1 A4 sheet) is well prepared. You can see my help sheets <a title="MA1505 &amp; MA1506 Help Sheets" href="https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/ma1505-ma1506-help-sheets/" target="_blank">here for reference</a> or <a title="MA1505/MA1506 Helpsheets" href="http://harishv7.github.io/nus/2015/05/26/MA1505%20&amp;%20MA1506%20Help%20Sheets/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, a manageable module, provided sufficient effort is put in to understand fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: <strong>B+</strong> <br />
Difficulty: Manageable</p>

<p>Hope the above reviews and tips were helpful! Comments are welcome (use the Disqus thread below).</p>

<p>Cheers,
Harish</p>
