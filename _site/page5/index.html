    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 May 2015</span>

    <p>Both MA1505 and MA1506 are common modules undertaken by a vast majority of engineering students. They are not exactly easy, and so I thought I will post the helpsheets I have made for my examinations here in the hope that some of the students may find it useful when doing their own helpsheets.</p>

<p>Do note that it is crucial for students to make their own helpsheets as printed or photocopied helpsheets are strictly not allowed. And from experience, it always helps to make your own helpsheet as it comes in as a form of revision.</p>

        NOC Interview (Round 1)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 May 2015</span>

    <p>I went for the NOC interview a few weeks back, just before my final examinations for semester 2. As it was mentioned in the confirmatione email, it was agroup interview indeed. My session was on the morning of Thursday and had about 8 people including me.</p>

<p>We were divided into 2 groups and given a hypothetical situation to discuss upon. In my case, we were given 2 simple business models (not as complex as you think) and then we had to discuss which business model will be more successful in the long run. The interviewers were very friendly and approachable. It is crucial to note that the interviewers are NOT looking for a correct answer. In fact, there is no right or wrong answer and it depends entirely upon how you feel. As long as you and your groupmates agree upon a common model and explain in as much detail as possible why it is the better one, you would have done your job.</p>

<p>In such group interview situations, the best way to make an impression is to try and lead the discussion from the start, which I did. So, instead of sitting around and looking at each other in awkward silence, initate the discussion and the overview. It was a good thing that all members of my team agreed uniformly on the model I had in mind. Then, immediately after settling the main topic of discussion, I tried to model the scope of the discussion by listing out the relevant factors to the topic. After which, I decided on the factors I will be presenting and the subsequent allocation of the other factors for my group members to present.</p>

<p>Overall the presentation went very well and at the end of the discussion it seemed that the interviewers did agree with our choice of model. I was happy to receive the news that I have successfully passed the first stage of the selection and am current anticipating the second round of interview coming soon in August/September.</p>

<p><strong>Points I learnt: </strong>
You are being noted once you step into the interview room. Everything that you say and do will have an impact on the impression the interviewers have on you.
Learn to be concise. It’s not necessary to talk as much as possible to show that you are good. Being concise will show that you have a clear mind and are focused on what you are doing.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

        Catching Up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2015</span>

    <p>It has been a hectic semester! Seems like the last time I blogged was before my semester. In NUS they always say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only easy semester was the last semester.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it might be true. I was a little confident that the first semester would have helped me to adjust to the environment and that the second semester will be much easier to cope. Though I have gotten used to the environment, the workload is definitely on the rise.</p>

<p>It is extremely hard to achieve a work-life balance as there is a lot of pressure to give your best. I realise that I can achieve well when I really appreciate and love what I am learning instead of going through the motion of education at college.</p>

<p>Thankfully summer is finally here and I hope to get a good break. I have a lot of mini projects to accomplish this summer.</p>

<p>One of the projects will be Friendezvous, which I am doing for a “module” called Orbital. Please do support me by liking the Facebook page <a href="www.fb.com/ProjectFriendezvous">here.</a></p>

<p>My module reviews for the previous semester are on their way! ;)</p>

<p>Till then,<br />

        Thoughts with Mass???
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2015</span>

    <p><a href="https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-140" src="https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/uni6.gif?w=250" alt="https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif" width="250" height="300" />Image Credits: https://helenmagnani.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>As I was reading The Lost Symbol, by Dan Brown, there was an interesting idea shared which immediately awed me. It deals with the hypothetical question: “Do thoughts have mass?”. Though, on a weighing scale, thoughts may possess mass ranging in the nano to femto scale, if they do have a mass, there will be many implications.</p>

<p>One of which was presented in the book was on gravity. If our thoughts had some mass, they will be bound by the laws of physics. Which meant, they will exert a gravitational force on other matter (though the force is of a very very small scale). Despite the insignificant amount force by a single thought, when a group of people come together to think on the same idea, this collective force becomes significant. It might then start to attract others towards this idea or notion. And that, will be powerful, when a thought can attract others and influence them to think in a certain way too.</p>

<p>Although it is a hypothetical question, the implications simply awed me. Upon further thinking: With thoughts having some mass, they will also be bounded by the Law of Conservation of Energy. Thoughts cannot be destroyed entirely. Instead, the thoughts are simply converted from one thought/idea to another. Or, they may become converted into another form of energy (likely chemical energy) in the brain.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is fascinating to imagine the implications if such a hypothesis was proven to be real. Whether it is true if thoughts have mass or not, only time will tell.</p>

<p>A few of my favourite quotes on the power of thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change your thoughts and you change your world. <br />
<strong>Norman Vincent Peale</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far. <br />
<strong>Swami Vivekananda</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus. <br />
<strong>Alexander Graham Bell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results. <br />
<strong>Wade Boggs</strong></p>

      <a href="/blog/nus/2014/12/29/NUS%20Gradeless%20First%20Sem/">
        NUS Gradeless First Semester
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>NUS has introduced gradeless first semester since AY2014/15. And I am from AY14/15 batch. Though gradeless semester seems enticing, there’s really more to it. There are some conditions and pointers to take note which will leave you confused if you’re not used to the NUS system.</p>

<p>Some things to know: NUS utilises the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) to determine the performance of a student.</p>

<p>Formula for determining CAP: <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-126" src="https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screen-shot-2014-12-24-at-1-29-19-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-24 at 1.29.19 pm" width="300" height="32" /></p>

<p>Basically the numerator is the sum of the product of module credits and grade points and the denominator is the sum of the module credits for ALL the modules taken so far. It’s crucial to note the cumulative function of the CAP. Hence, it is not determined on a per semester basis, but rather for the 3-4 years of modules taken.</p>

<p>To maximise the S/U options given during the gradeless semester, there are some things to note first.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the class of degree you're aiming for.
<ul>
<li>Degrees awarded are classified as shown (taken from NUS website):
<table border="5" style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td><strong>Honours Degree Classification</strong></td>
<td><strong>Criteria</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Honours (Highest Distinction)</td>
<td>CAP 4.50 and above</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Honours (Distinction)</td>
<td>4.0 to 4.49</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Honours (Merit)</td>
<td>3.5 to 3.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Honours</td>
<td>3.0 to 3.49</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pass</td>
<td>2.0 to 2.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fail</td>
<td>Below 2.0</td>
</tr>
</table>

<li>Note the Grade Point table:
<table border="1" style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td><strong>Letter Grades:</strong></td>
<td>A+</td><td>A</td><td>A-</td><td>B+</td><td>B</td><td>B-</td><td>C+</td><td>C</td><td>D+</td><td>D</td><td>F</td>

<li>If the target is Honours (Highest Distinction), then a CAP of 4.50 and above is required by the end of your 3-4 years. To achieve this, the average grade for the modules you took for 4 years must be at least an A-.</li>
<li>Therefore, during the S/U option, S/U anything below A- is a good option, since it will increase the number of modules with grades A- and above</li>

</li>
<li>If the first semester is a good indication of the performance for the rest of the semesters, then S/Uing any modules with a gradepoint below your CAP is a good idea. For example, your CAP is 4.44, and your grades are A,A-, A,B+,B+, then S/U modules below 4.44 which are the 2 B+.</li>
<li>The gradepoints allocated to the grades, for example 4.0 for a B+ means it will pull your overall CAP towards the 4.0. Hence, unless the overall CAP is below 4.0, then B+ would not really help with pushing the CAP upwards.</li>
