<h2> CS2010: Data Structures &amp; Algorithms II </h2>

<p>This module is one of my favourite modules in this semester. Usually CS2010 is taught by Prof Steven Halim, but it was Dr Brown this semester who is teaching this module for the first time in NUS. Dr Brown was really great and funny as well. He tried to bring across the concepts taught very well and in my opinion one of the coolest professors I have seen. Once I required an extension to one of the important lab assignments and he was so chill about it and totally understands students’ positions. Also, this is a must-take module for any computer science person as it introduces the key algorithms that has made the tech world around us possible.</p>

<p>The course weight he is divided into assignments, labs, lecture quizzes, mid term and final exams. Yes, the weightage is pretty diversified across the various components. It’s important to be consistent in this module as the further weightage for each lab or assignment would also vary depending on the difficulty. The rough breakdown of the course weightage is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-lecture exercises (8%) – Mini-assignments done during lecture</li>
  <li>Lab exercises (12%) – Similar to assignments but shorter and easier</li>
  <li>Four Assignments (40%) – Weighted differently depending on difficulty</li>
  <li>Exams (40%) – Midterm + Final</li>
</ul>

<p>The course structure is basically an introduction to trees, heaps, hash tables in the first half followed by a heavy focus on graphs in the second half.</p>

<p>Overall a great and crucial module to take for  any computer science or engineering student.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: A</p>

<hr />

<h2> EE2024: Programming for Computer Interfaces </h2>

<p>This module was one of the heaviest, if not, the heaviest module I have ever taken. The course mainly focuses on Assembly language in the first half and low-level C programming for computer interfaces in the second half. Both halves consist of a related project done in pairs. While the first project is largely manageable, the second project is huge and is extremely time intensive. In fact, I don’t remember doing anything other than this module in the last 3-4 weeks of the semester. My partner and myself came to NUS at 10am and left at 10pm daily for these weeks. It was an extremely challenging period.</p>

<p>Tip for projects is to 1) Start early &amp; 2) Use the resources around you to learn fully (both online &amp; offline).</p>

<p>While this module is definitely useful as it gives great in depth understanding of how devices around us were programmed and interfaced, the content was so heavy that I couldn’t get enough time to appreciate everything I learnt. Nevertheless, the module helped me understand the importance of several technologies such as UART, master-slave protocols etc and their applications.</p>

<p>Final exams were slightly hard as expected. Nevertheless, Prof Rajesh went through all the past year papers one by one during the last few weeks as solutions to the papers are not released. That really helped to clarify a lot of the learning gaps and also on the expectations for the final paper.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: A-</p>

<hr />

<h2> CG2271: Real-Time Operating Systems </h2>

<p>Overall a great module. Took this under Prof Tulika. This is actually the CEG counterpart module of the CS version of Operating Systems. Hence most of the focus was on the lower level areas.</p>

<p>The module is structured into labs, midterms and finals. Also, there is a small component for tutorial attendance. Most of the earlier labs are manageable. However, as we moved along into the later parts, I found the labs to be harder not because of the concepts but mostly the debugging of programs and identifying where we went wrong. Hence, it became a little time-intensive too. Labs are done in pairs using a Spark fun (Arduino) kit.</p>

<p>Attending lectures (or watching webcasts) is important to help in the understanding. I actually enjoyed this module quite a bit. And after the module was completed, I began appreciating the use of many of the concepts I have learnt. Concepts such as semaphores, mutexes are so crucial and they are being used everywhere around us.</p>

<p>Final exams were pretty hard as compared to the midterms, but manageable.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: A</p>

<hr />

<h2> ST2334: Statistics </h2>

<p>Statistics is a useful and slightly easier than the other modules I took this semester. However, easier means others will also find it easy. I guess the competition for the module was a little high.</p>

<p>The notes were pretty self explanatory out of the times and there are plenty of problems to practice. Both midterms and final exams were pretty okay.</p>

<p>Module structure is mostly based on IVLE quizzes, tutorial attendance, tutorial participation, midterms and finals. Important tip for this module is to be consistent. And the lecturer did make sure we are consistent by giving online quizzes each week and tutorials on alternate weeks.</p>

<p>Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obZ0RWQkJGYUlLOVE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1oba2UyN2QzRFVRaVU">here</a>.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: B+</p>

<hr />

<h2> CG2023: Signals &amp; Systems </h2>

<p>Signals and Systems was an intimidating module for me at first. Looking at so much math and complex terms didn’t help in motivating myself to study. However as time went by, I realised it wasn’t that hard after all. The only requirement to do well in this module is the investment of time. Understanding of the concepts comes over time and dedication  to read the notes again and again. Do this till you understand. Whenever I felt unsure, I used the recommended textbook to write down a few problems and solve then to check my understanding.</p>

<p>For midterms and finals, it is very crucial to practice a lot of the past year papers to clarify on the difficulty level and on what is expected.</p>

<p>The professors were also kind and helpful whenever we approach them with questions. For this module, we just need the discipline to sit down and invest some time in the understanding of the concepts taught.</p>

<p>Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obc0NZNUp5T0JoSnM">here</a>.</p>

<p>Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obMk5kWU5mdk1LM0E">here</a>.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆</p>

<p>Grade Obtained: A</p>

<p>As usual, it was the most hectic semester I’ve had. Till next time, cheers.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>While it was extremely tiring, it was really a fulfilling experience. In that intense 24 hours, I actually learnt so much skills. It also proved that to learn something new, we only needed the determination and the dedication to pursue it.</p>

<p>Alvian has always been interested in the topics of data science and machine learning. Naturally, he was able to lead our discussion and ideas prior to the building of the actual application. I was in charge of developing the desktop client to communicate with the APIs provided by Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>Initially, I tried using simple AJAX calls through a website. However, it did not work due to some error relating to the blockage of “Cross-Origin Requests”. After about 2 hours and going through multiple StackOverflow questions, we decided to change track. I never thought my experience in a previous module, CS2103 Software Engineering, will help me. I used the good old legacy language Java as it was stable and what everyone in my team knew best. Our technology stack was essentially JavaFX to design the layout the GUI and pure Java for the backend logic.</p>

<p>Both Ida and Chris helped me and Alvian to get the building of the application done. Meanwhile, Alvian started training the model for our app with the data provided by <a href="https://data.gov.sg/developer">https://data.gov.sg/developer</a>.</p>

<p>After getting through the initial round, my team was selected for the finals where we had to present to a panel of judges. It was really a tough experience. Imagine 24 hours++ without sleep and still needing the energy to be able to present lively to the audience in front of you.</p>

<p>While we did not obtain the top 3 prizes, I was definitely overjoyed to have my team in the 5th place considering that we were all just sophomores in NUS without much experience in these field. I definitely look forward to participating in the next challenge.</p>

        Ask NOC - Honestbee & Shopback Sharing Session
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2016</span>

    <p>Recently, I attended 2 talks during askNOC. There were two invited guests: Jonathan Low from Honestbee and Henry Chan from Shopback. Both companies are startups, having only been in the market for around a year or so. Today’s sharing was largely focused on their business and how they overcame the various challenges.</p>

<p>Honestbee is a concierge and online delivery service for grocery shopping. So essentially, customers can place orders online for groceries or items found at common supermarkets such as NTUC. The ‘bees’ from the company are actuallly people who will shop the necessary items and deliver them to you in an hour. I personally found this a great idea for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is a huge incentive for consumers to use this product because there are no additional costs. The items are bought at the same prevailing price at the supermarket. Secondly, consumers can order from the convenience of their home. Thirdly, as mentioned by Jonathan, this is an asset light model. There are no storage or warehouse involved. Every purchase is made directly at the supermarket which means storage is well taken care of. Essentially, the only services that they are providing will be the shopping and delivery of items. They are able to grow well with the use of technology. For example, internally they use an Android app that allows ‘bees’ to receive orders. Nevertheless, Jonathan mentioned that currently it is still exists as a manual process. This can definitely be automated to reduced much of the overhead costs. An order can immediately be routed to a free ‘bee’ together with the list of items etc. Doing so will help save time and manpower costs as well as allow them to garner good analytics into the demographics and patterns of their customers.</p>

<p>Talking about how Honestbee works, Jonathan also provided some good insights into the business model. They utilise a revenue share model. Taking an example of an order of $100, they will be able to obtain a 20% commission. Out of this $20, their overall profit is only $10 as shown below.
$20-$5(shopper cost)-$5(delivery  cost) = $10</p>

<p>There are several teams in Honestbee which work together. These include: business, customer service, product (engineering, design, data), operations teams. He emphasised the crucial need for each of these teams to work hand in hand and communicate effectively.</p>

<p>Jonathan also shared the various challenges he faced. Factoring in the customer acquisition costs, each customer only turns profitable from the fifth order onwards. Also, he mentioned the poor visibility they have on stock availability. This is especially true due to their reliance on the supermarket to have the various products they are looking for.
Also, delivery costs are only minimised with economies of scale.</p>

<p>The second talk was by Henry Chan from Shopback. Shopback is based on the idea of customers getting cashbacks on their online purchases. Henry provided some great insights on e-commerce as a whole. He pointed out that e-commerce in Southeast Asia has a very low penetration rate which essentially means a huge growth opportunity for the next 5-6 years. One of the key markets to tap on will be Indonesia where online shopping and mobile penetration rates are growing rapidly. Henry also emphasised that entrepreneurs must be willing to learn and have the hunger to achieve and that expanding your business is all about having the right people around you. This pointed out the importance of networking, about having good contacts in the business world.</p>

<p>When asked how his business adapts to smaller markets where technology is generally less advanced, he said that such a situation is indeed a good opportunity where you can have greater expansion and tap deeper into the market.</p>

<p>One of the interesting questions was if both the founders give employees stock options. I felt that this is a great way to align employees’ interests together with the company’s goals. While stock options may not guarantee any value, this orientation towards a common goal is crucial in my opinion.</p>

<p>Lastly, both of them provided an important tip for budding entrepreneurs:Don’t be shy in validating your idea. One of them even mentioned, that they requested people in Starbucks to test drive their prototype and gain feedback. I am sure validation is a crucial part every new product has to achieve and this must be done early in the prototyping stage itself.</p>

<p>Learnt a lot from this session and definitely looking forward to the next session.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

        Second Year, First Semester in Review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>The following blog post is also available on my Wordpress site <a href="https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/12/24/second-year-first-semester-in-review/">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The past semester is definitely the busiest semester I have been through. There was literally no time for anything else other than studies and projects. Part of the reason (as you will see), is that I took 8 modules this time. However, one of them, CP3108B - Orbital has already been completed. Two of the other modules CP2201 and CFG1001 lasted only for the first half of the semester, thankfully. This allowed for a slightly relaxed timetable in the second half of the semester.</p>

<p>Right now, I am really glad that I managed to do my best through the semester. And for those who are anticipating such a semester, I felt you might find a review of the modules handy. So here it is:</p>

<hr />

<h2> CP 2201: Journey of the Innovator </h2>

<p>This is a module about entrepreneurship and is worth 2 MCs. The grading is also in the form of Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or Completed Unsatisfactorily (CU) which means that the grade obtained will not affect the current CAP you have.</p>

<p>Personally, I found this module to be very engaging and entertaining. It provided me with what I wanted to learn about entrepreneurship. Each week, there were invited guest speakers who share their experience on entrepreneurship. A typical outline of the module looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1: Introduction to module and some basic information</li>
  <li>Week 2: Guest speakers from PropertyGuru and Reebonz with Q&amp;A</li>
  <li>Week 3: Guest speakers from upcoming startups: Klinify, Lomotif and InvestingNote with Q&amp;A</li>
  <li>Week 4: Guest speakers from Red Dot Ventures and Golden Gate Venture with Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>

<p>Each week, there will be a short assignment which requires some reflection on various aspects of entrepreneurship as well as the guest speakers and the companies.</p>

<p>All in all a great module to learn from entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>PS: Oh did I mention that there is a buffet dinner and networking session for 30 mins weekly?</p>

<h2> CS2101: Effective Communication for Computing Professionals </h2>

<p>This is a twinned module with CS2103T (see below). Basically, this module teaches you to write and present your ideas in an effective manner. Communication skills, writing skills and presentation skills are the 3 most crucial skills required to do well.</p>

<p>I found this module good as I was able to pick up on the above-mentioned skills. However, there are a number of continual assessments for this module since there are no final exams. This means you will be kept busy almost every week.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some of the CAs are simple activities like doing a reflection on communication or your oral presentations. Some of the assessments I remember doing are:
- Reflection on Communication Skills &amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Oral Presentation 1 (OP1)
- Writing a Project Proposal
- Writing of a Progress Report on the software project
- Oral Presentation 2 (OP2)
- Reflection 2 on OP2 &amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Writing of a Project Manual (Developer and User Guide)</p>

<p>To do well in this module, it is crucial to have the enthusiasm and appreciation for what you are doing. Of course, that will also help you to be more participative in your class (participation is also counted for grading). Also, I cannot emphasise enough on having a good team who can support you in these tasks. This is definitely not a one-man-army type of module for you to do alone. Effective teamwork is important in bringing out the best in most parts of the module.</p>

<h2> CS2013T - Software Engineering </h2>

<p>I have been looking forward to this module for some time. Personally, I love software engineering and development.</p>

<p>This module was personally very enriching and I got to learn a lot in terms of the various software engineering principles. That being said, this is one of the most hectic modules. As a team of 4, we were tasked to build a desktop-based task manager from scratch which had a primary input through the keyboard. By task manager, I mean a productivity software akin to popular ones like Google Keep, Todoist, Wunderlist, Any.do etc.</p>

<p>The grading of the module was divided into 3 main areas: Project (50%), Final Exam (40%) and Participation (10%). As such, the project hold the majority of the weightage and that makes this module different from conventional ones. We apply what we learn. Every week, the lecture introduces new principles and concepts relevant to software engineering. Much of these knowledge can be immediately applied to the project we are doing.</p>

<p>CS2103T is also twinned with CS2101 (as described above). Hence, many of the things we do such as developer’s guide, user guide etc. are relevant to the project. The use of version control (Git or GitHub) is extremely crucial for the project and came in really handy. We are prone to introduce bugs/errors when 3-4 people “operate” on the code simultaneously. Having revision control allowed such to keep track of these changes and simply revert our changes if we found them to be buggy later on.</p>

<p>The participation segment is the easiest to score and you should definitely score the full 10% here. Points can be earned through the proper completion of pre-tutorial and in-tutorial activities, answering questions in lectures, successful completion of weekly lectures quizzes on IVLE etc. There is maximum cap of 200 points which means that any points exceeding the 200th mark will not contribute to the participation points for grading.</p>

<p>The final exam tests the skills we have learnt throughout the semester. If you have learnt and applied these concepts well for the software project, it will be much easier to score here. The CS2103T module handbook (a 200-page document/textbook companion) is a must-read for scoring well for the exams. It helps to reinforce the concepts learnt and clears the small gaps in understanding.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I learnt a lot through this module. My team and I managed to create quite a cool desktop application called “FINI”. The name inspired from French, in which Fini refers to finished or accomplished. We felt that this accurately represents the goal of our app and it was easy to remember too! 
These are some of the screenshots of the application:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OIFjxyi.png" alt="FINI's Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Over time, my team and I became really passionate about what we were doing and we even made a cool video for our Oral Presentation 2 in CS2101 and to also serve as an introductory product demo video during our CS2103T demonstration. Here it is:</p>

<p>FINI is available for download and use here: <a href="https://github.com/cs2103aug2015-t16-1j/fini/releases/tag/v0.5">GitHub Link</a></p>

<p>Overall, an interesting yet hectic module. If you love creating cool stuff, you will love this module.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆	☆ ☆</p>

<h2> EE2020 - Digital Fundamentals </h2>

<p>This is a 5MCs module which is split into 2 parts. The first part is relatively easier to understand and introduces the basic building blocks of computers such as logic gates. The second part is focused mostly on slightly more intricate topics such as Finite State Machines (FSMs).</p>

<p>There are also lab and project components in this module. The labs are mostly manageable and primarily introduces the use of FPGAs and the hardware description language known as Verilog. The project is done individually and it involved creating an oscilloscope out of the FPGA. This was really cool because oscilloscopes generally cost many hundreds of dollars. Using a simple FPGA to create an oscilloscope was indeed interesting!</p>

<p>Most of it involved writing Verilog for the FPGA to interpret and display the incoming signal from the signal generators in the lab. The project was graded individually with a range of criteria. Two main influencing factors are the number of features (such as scaling, translating, displaying words/labels, pointers) and the uniqueness of the features <em>as compared to your peers</em>.</p>

<p>There are no final exams. Instead there is a midterm quiz and final quiz (each 20%) and the rest of the assessment is based on labs and projects.</p>

<p>On the whole, a manageable module. Be creative with the project.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆</p>

<hr />

<h2> EE2021 - Devices and Circuits </h2>

<p>This module has a lot of theory and formulas on semiconductors. Personally, I found it quite intensive and usually took me the most time out of all my modules to revise and gain a complete understanding of what was being taught.</p>

<p>The assessment for this module is Homework (10%), Midterm test (20%), Quiz (5%), Final Exam (65%), though I do not remember taking a quiz for the 5%.</p>

<p>The topics covered were very structured starting from the building blocks and slowly moving on to bigger components: Semiconductors -&gt; PN junctions -&gt; Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT) -&gt; Metal Oxide Semiconductors Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) -&gt; CMOS Logic -&gt; Single Stage Amplifiers -&gt; Multistage Amplifiers -&gt; Opamps.</p>

<p>This was really overwhelming and was like a bit of PC1432 again. The first part (before midterms) is usually much easier to understand than the second part. So make sure you ace the midterms.</p>

<p>On the whole, a difficult module indeed due to the time commitment for understanding and revision. If you can appreciate what you learn, it will greatly help in the learning process.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>

<h2> LAF1201 - French 1 </h2>

<p>I took this module out of curiosity and the eagerness to learn a new language. I had shortlisted Chinese, Hindi and French and finally decided on French.</p>

<p>Why? Firstly, we need to understand that learning a language takes considerable time and effort to both learn, grasp and then practice speaking it. And doing all this while juggling other modules during a period of 1 semester is not a joke. French is apparently written with English alphabets with some accented ones. Also, it is similar to English or rather English is similar to French. As compared to other languages like Chinese and Hindi, this meant that I do not need to spend extra time learning to write the new alphabets which would help to save a considerable amount of time.</p>

<p>I must say French was really awesome. The people I met were mostly from FASS, but there were a few of them like me from Engineering or some from Pharmacy and Business. I really liked like environment. It was very interactive and my lecturer Dr Daniel Chan made sure everyone participated in each lesson. The interaction and fun during lessons made me like French even more. To ensure this interaction, all lessons are tutorials (no lectures).</p>

<p>Workload wise, since there are no final exams, you will be having tests / quizzes / homework more frequently than you would have expected to. There are quizzes on the French culture, vocabulary, grammar, audio recording of a self-introduction, writing of an email for an imaginative scenario etc. The final test is an oral conversation between 2 you and two others from your group in front of the lecturer.</p>

<p>I would say it is relatively easy to score for the tests if you have consistently practised French (both writing and speaking). That being said, also means that your peers will score well. Personal advice is to revise the notes posted on IVLE and use Google Translate to its fullest capability. I also utilised the <a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> app (web &amp; mobile) to learn much of the content. Oh yes, if you have an iPhone, you can set the language for Siri as French and converse with it in French. It’s quite cool and you can also check on your pronunciation by seeing if Siri understands what you just said.</p>

<p>All in all, a very enjoyable module taught by a great lecturer.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆</p>

<h2> CP3108B - Independent Work (Orbital Programme) </h2>

<p>I participated in the Orbital programme during the summer break before my semester 1. I have written a post on the Orbital experience which is available <a href="http://harishv7.github.io/blog/education/nus/college/techstuff/2015/08/19/Orbital%202015/">here</a> and <a href="https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/orbital-2015">here</a>.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆	☆</p>

<hr />

<h2> CFG1001 - Headstart Module </h2>

<p>While this is a 0 MCs module to prepare you for your career, there is a reason I have written about it here. Before attending the sessions, I was a little complacent and thought of this module as something that is snatching my precious time away. However, upon attending the module, I thought differently.</p>

<p>This module helps to expose how it is like in the “real” world outside of NUS. Preparing for a career also includes preparing for the various interviews, networking with others etc. And it helped me understand and appreciate the importance of many skills and pointers which will definitely come in handy during my interview applications etc.</p>

<p>This module is graded with a Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or CU (Completed Unsatisfactorily) grade. You’ll just need to attend all the 2-3 face-to-face sessions to get a CS grade.</p>

<p>Difficulty (out of 5): (Nil)</p>

<hr />

<p>And, I just realised I have 4 consecutive exams in the coming semester!</p>

<p>Guess I need to mentally prepare for it. After all, the only easy semester was the last semester!</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />
