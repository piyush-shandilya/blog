        Lessons from Entrepreneurs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>Over the past semester, I undertook a module in NUS known as “Journey of the Innovator” (CP2201). More than just a module, it was conducted in an interesting and engaging seminar style. Each week, many lessons on entrepreneurship were shared and in one of the weeks, 3 startup founders were invited to share their views and insights into entrepreneurship.</p>

<h2 id="klinify">Klinify</h2>

<p>The first talk was by Krish, the CEO and Founder of Klinify. Personally, I found Klinify’s mission to “provide the freedom of paper with the power of digital technology” intriguing. It aims to propagate a change within the medical industry and empower doctors to harness the strengths of technology to further improve the medical services being delivered. During his talk, Krish mentioned some importants points on entrepreneurship that he has learnt thus far. I have combined those pointers, together with my learning points from the talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on a specific sector: Klinify’s target audience are very specific. It is specifically targeted at the providers of medical service, doctors. While their ultimate goal is to extend the platform of Klinify globally, their current milestone is to establish themselves in Singapore and in Asia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Klinify offers hybrid storage: This might be a little technical. Conventionally, a patients records (in paper) are only available physcially in the hospital. However, by digitalizing medical recors, now patient records are both available locally and on the cloud. By sharing it on the cloud, the medical records are now more accessible than ever. This could even offer a centralised patient records system to help doctors view and understand the patient’s medical history well before treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasons for Klinify’s potential success: Klinify does not aim to change doctors’ natural way of doing things. Their workflow remains the same. Doctors are still able to write like they do on paper. They have customised templates. They can attach photos and even annotate. All these features help doctors to transition from their current pen-and-paper workflow to the digital platform with ease.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some concerns on Klinify: Security. Technology rules today’s world. However, the growth of technology has brought about potential incentives for people to expose data. Medical records are meant to be private. In an event of a security breach, millions of medical records can be leaked. However, during the talk, Krish did mention their focus to ensure the safety and privacy of patient records. And only a strong defence system can deter such security compromises.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lomotif">Lomotif</h2>

<p>The second talk was by Paul from Lomotif. Lomotif is essentially a mobile application that allows users to create a video from their stash of videos and even add songs to it. After using it, a clear winning point of Lomotif was the usability factor. It was very simple to use and even a novice mobile user will be able to use it easily. 
Some pointers from Paul:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Market saturation: There will be a point in time when your target market becomes saturated. And Paul mentions that we should definitely anticipate this. To overcome this, we need to try and leverage on another market. I think this can be done in a couple of ways. Various markets are segmented by factors such as age, culture and perception. Hence, an expansion into another market requires a change in the app / technology that addresses one or more of these factors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some interesting features of Lomotif: It’s collaborative, expressive and fun. This fun factor is one of the main reasons which helps Lomotif stand out from its competitors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 Crucial Factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Good Team</li>
      <li>Customer Acquisition</li>
      <li>Making your customers happy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="investing-note">Investing Note</h2>

<p>The third talk was by Shanison from InvestingNote. InvestingNote is a social network site targeted specifically at investors in Singapore and in the regional space.</p>

<p>Upon using the InvestingNote platform, I like the user-friendly interface and the summarised view of stocks/shares and other information. Personally, I believe that such a social-platform can be of great use to investors. Facilitating communication among investors is something new I have seen and if brought about to the target market correctly, I believe this can be a good success.</p>

<p>I feel the above pointers are critical in ensuring the success of the start-up. While it may be true that most start-ups fail eventually, I think keeping the above pointers in mind will definitely aid them to beat the market.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

        Entrepreneurship - Yay or Nay?

    <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.</p>

<p>The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.</p>

<h3 id="several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as">Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.</li>
  <li>Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.</li>
  <li>Think big, and expand big.</li>
  <li>Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.</li>
  <li>Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).</li>
  <li>With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru">Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:</h3>
<p>The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!</p>

<p>Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.</li>
  <li>Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.</li>
  <li>Size and Valuation</li>
  <li>Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.</li>
  <li>Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.</li>
  <li>A good M&amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.</li>
</ul>

<p>A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble</p>

<p>Some great quotes I found during the presentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”</p>

  <p>“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz">The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:</h3>

<p>Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.</li>
  <li>Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.</li>
  <li>For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.</li>
  <li>Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.</li>
  <li>Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.</li>
  <li>Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.</li>
  <li>Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.</li>
  <li>Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.</li>
  <li>Maximise existing resources to create value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”</p>

  <p>“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”</p>

  <p>“Instead of finding places where there is already competition, find niche areas where you can dominate the business”</p>

  <p>“See opportunities in problems”</p>

  <p>“Get a MVP, or beta model and launch it. Only then you will receive feedback on what the market wants.”</p>

  <p>“Only the paranoid survives” – Quoted from Andrew Grove, Co-Founder of Intel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, a very fruitful session that stirred up the entrepreneur within me. The world needs change, and only innovation can drive that change. And entrepreneurs can lead that innovation. In that regard, I am motivated to become an entrepreneur myself to help make positive difference in the world.</p>

<p>After 3 months of hard work, the Orbital programme came to a close on 19th Aug 2015. It was a great experience and I picked up many skills of both front and back end development. I did the project with Al who was very supportive during the 3 months though he was on vacation.</p>

<p>The project’s inspiration came from our shared experiences in daily college life. Many of the times we tend to organise meetings manually. A typical process goes like this (A,B,C are persons).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A–&gt;B: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? <br />
B–&gt;A: Yup, that’ll be good I guess. <br />
A–&gt;C: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? <br />
C–&gt;A: Oh no, I don’t think I’ll be free. How about some other day? <br />
A (thinks to him/herself): Darn, got to ask B and C for another timing again! <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As shown above, the typical manual process is tedious where we often WhatsApp or message one another for free slots and try to match it all up for a common time to meet. In the point of view of the meeting administrator, it is a rather painstaking process when he/she has to repeatedly ask the team members for a suitable time to meet.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, I suggested to Al that we should maybe develop a platform which can make the organising of meetings simpler and redefine the ways of doing so. And from there, Friendezvous was born. Friendezvous is an amalgamation of the words Friend and Rendezvous (a meeting at an agreed time and place). So essentially Friendezvous refers to meetings with friends, colleagues etc. And we decided on a relevant tagline as well: “Organising meetings, redefined.”.</p>

<p>I think I should describe a little of the technical aspects of Friendezvous as well. Friendezvous was built using the good old LAMP stack. We used PHP and MySQL along with front-end technologies/frameworks such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap (modified), Angular JS. The development itself was not the difficult part. The hardest part of this journey was to think as an user of this platform. How would an user using Friendezvous feel about the workflow of this app? Is it too complicated? Can we improve on the workflow to minimise the number of steps/clicks an user is required to make to achieve an objective? These are the various questions which were running on our minds all the time. After all, software/app development is not just about blinding writing code.</p>

<p>There is much more to that.</p>

<p>We are dealing with real life users here. Then, we decided to conduct a survey to analyse the perception of our target audience towards the platform. We did it with a closed circle of friends and received very positive feedback. It was definitely a morale booster to our idea and efforts. More than anything, we were passionate about what we did. Even if we made a positive difference in a single person’s life, it would mean a lot to us.</p>

<p>Orbital Splashdown, where all the teams (from beginner, intermediate &amp; advanced levels) came together to showcase their work, was held on 19th August 2015. It was exhilarating to see so many applications built by students like myself. I was inspired by many apps, with their technical aspects as well as the business models they were planning to develop.</p>

<p>I was extremely joyful when the visitors to my booth exclaimed “Wow, that is one app I think I would use!” or “This is an excellent app bro!”. They were also impressed at the various features like notification tracking and location suggestions Friendezvous offered.</p>

<p>On the whole, Orbital 2015 was an exciting journey. I am going to make it a point to develop an application every summer. I find fulfilment in learning so many technologies.</p>

<p>As for Friendezvous, currently it is available here: <a href="http://friendezvous.herokuapp.com">Friendezvous</a>.</p>

<p>Development is very active and Al and myself aim to launch Friendezvous as a commercial platform soon (in about 3-5 months). After which, we are planning on porting this towards an Android and iOS application as well.</p>

<p>Do try Friendezvous if you can and send me your comments in the comment box on my blog or to my <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#097;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#104;&#050;&#048;&#055;&#064;&#108;&#105;&#118;&#101;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="http://www.wreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CyberSecurity.jpg" alt="Computer Security" /></p>

<p>Being quite free during the summer vacation period, I decided to take up CS2107: Introduction to Information and System Security in Special Term 2. It was one of the most interesting modules I have taken taught by an ever youthful professor Hugh. His energy and enthusiasm and deep knowledge on computer security made me even more curious in the various aspects of computer security.</p>

<p>This module covers a wide range of topics from cryptography/ciphers, to common hacking methods (SQLi, Buffer overflows), protection mechanisms against such malcious attacks etc. The assessment was split into the following:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Homework &amp; Assignments</td>
		<td>Project Work</td>
		<td>Final Exam</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>10%</td>
		<td>40%</td>
		<td>50%</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>There were a total of 3 assignments (about 5-10 questions) which were to be done at home. They were largely manageable. Google is your best friend. Computer security is a broad topic and the more you learn, the better you understand and appreciate the various concepts.</p>

<p>The project work was indeed an interesting experience. My team consisted of Sri (not his real name), QY and myself. It was a tight timeline considering that the project was to be completed over a span of just 6 weeks. We embarked on the project about 2 weeks before submission, but we made the structure of the report very clear. Regular consultation with Prof Hugh was crucial in helping us achieve a clear understanding of the expectations of this project. As a team, we are really thankful for his advice and guidance.</p>

<p>Our project was on “Common attacks on PC/UNIX/Mac devices”. Here focused on DDoS, Buffer Overflow exploitation and side-channel attacks. I personally involved myself largely towards the buffer overflow section in which I did code sample runs to check the implementation of a feature known as Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) on Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. We also compared the effectiveness the various operating systems against the aforementioned attacks and concluded Windows offered the best protection (of course, in reality there will be a wide range of external factors to be considered as well).</p>

<p>The final exam was manageable. I was able to refer to the relevant sections of the notes since it was an open-book examination. Some questions are specifically targeted at your understanding and some were on concepts mentioned in lectures. I guess it paid off to attend each and every lecture and tutorial.</p>

<p>I am really glad I took this module. It is one of the best modules I have taken in NUS thus far and am currently contemplating taking CS3235 (Introduction to Computer Security) sometime later. Then again, the number of required breadth electives for CEG students has been reduced to just 1 which means I need to plan my modules well.</p>

<p>Also taking it in Special Term was great since it allowed me to concentrate fully on one subject. In the regular semester, with 5-6 modules, juggling time between these modules itself is a huge task for most students.</p>

<p>Difficulty: <strong>Manageable</strong> <br />
Grade obtained: <strong>A-</strong> <br />
Remarks: Pretty interesting module taught by an amazing professor. Take it!</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />
