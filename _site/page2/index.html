    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KnFi8cM.png " alt="TwistedMaze Logo" style="width: 200px;" /></p>

<p>I recently participated in Gamecraft 2015. This is my 2nd time participating this is “game-hackathon”. This time my team consisted of Al, Ted, Chris &amp; myself. The theme for this year was “Twist”. As usual, the interpretation of this theme in relation to the game was left open to us.</p>

<p>One of the first things that came to my mind was a maze that twists. As I was imagining this idea, I suddenly had this inspiration from this book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner">The Mazerunner</a>. It is a book where a group of “hostages” have to escape from a ever-changing labyrinth. There has also been a movie released with the same name.</p>

<p>I suggested this idea and we tried brainstorming a few ideas before settling and finalising on this one. After this decision, we focused our efforts towards the game development. Me and Chris took on the roles of the game design where we made the shifting maps for the maze and the necessary sprites.</p>

<p>Ted was the sound engineer and gather suitable sounds for use in the game. Al, being the lead programmer of the group, devoted his attention to the game physics and the actual coding of the game.</p>

<p>We utilised Unity for the game and eventually (after 24 hrs) managed to come up with a finished game, TwistedMaze. TwistedMaze is available for download (both Mac and Windows versions) at <a href="https://github.com/harishv7/TwistedMaze/releases">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Future work on porting the game to Android and iOS is currently being discussed.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it. :)</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

        My Getting Things Done (GTD) Framework
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>We all talk about productivity and efficiency today. So here is my way of getting my things done.</p>

<p>I primarily use two platforms to get my stuff done: <a href="https://workflowy.com">Workflowy</a> and <a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>. Workflowy is an amazing platform that is buuilt on a simple idea: making lists. At first look, it may look so simple and plain and even no greater than a Notepad like web-app. But, it is amazing intuitive to use and I am usually able to structure and plan according the the priority of tasks.</p>

<p>I usually think in a structured, top-down way and I would probably attribute that to my engineering-based education. So a typical structure I impose in Workflowy is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Urgent</li>
  <li>Important</li>
  <li>Upcoming</li>
  <li>KIV</li>
</ol>

<p>These are listed in order of priority and shows me which task I need to get done next.</p>

<p>Under each of these categories, I make tasks and their relevant sub-tasks. For example, I have an Engineering exam this coming week, I create a task called “Engineering Exam”. Under this task, I include a label called “Details” which indicates the time, date and location of this task and “Revision” which then contains the relevant sections and chapters to revise as sub-sub-tasks.</p>

<p>One of the greatest things about Workflowy is that you can create many many layers of sub-sub-sub-sub-…. tasks. However, an important feature that is missing is reminders.</p>

<p>For this, I use Google Calendar. All deadlines and events immediately go into my Google Account with a default alert set for 1 and 2 days before the actual date. This together with my list of tasks of Workflowy keeps me organised.</p>

<p>I check this list at the start of the day and update it as and when tasks come in. At the end of the day, I check if all intended tasks for the day have been completed. If yes, I complete them. If no, I move and reschedule them on the level of priority. Before sleeping, I spend 5 minutes working out the relevant tasks and agenda for tomorrow by simply adding a hashtag (#tomrrow) beside the tasks in Workflowy.</p>

<p>This system has worked great so far and I believe it has been a key reason for my productivity too.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />

      <a href="/blog/general/2015/12/02/Lessons%20from%20Entrepreneurs/">
        Lessons from Entrepreneurs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>Over the past semester, I undertook a module in NUS known as “Journey of the Innovator” (CP2201). More than just a module, it was conducted in an interesting and engaging seminar style. Each week, many lessons on entrepreneurship were shared and in one of the weeks, 3 startup founders were invited to share their views and insights into entrepreneurship.</p>

<h2 id="klinify">Klinify</h2>

<p>The first talk was by Krish, the CEO and Founder of Klinify. Personally, I found Klinify’s mission to “provide the freedom of paper with the power of digital technology” intriguing. It aims to propagate a change within the medical industry and empower doctors to harness the strengths of technology to further improve the medical services being delivered. During his talk, Krish mentioned some importants points on entrepreneurship that he has learnt thus far. I have combined those pointers, together with my learning points from the talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Focus on a specific sector: Klinify’s target audience are very specific. It is specifically targeted at the providers of medical service, doctors. While their ultimate goal is to extend the platform of Klinify globally, their current milestone is to establish themselves in Singapore and in Asia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Klinify offers hybrid storage: This might be a little technical. Conventionally, a patients records (in paper) are only available physcially in the hospital. However, by digitalizing medical recors, now patient records are both available locally and on the cloud. By sharing it on the cloud, the medical records are now more accessible than ever. This could even offer a centralised patient records system to help doctors view and understand the patient’s medical history well before treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasons for Klinify’s potential success: Klinify does not aim to change doctors’ natural way of doing things. Their workflow remains the same. Doctors are still able to write like they do on paper. They have customised templates. They can attach photos and even annotate. All these features help doctors to transition from their current pen-and-paper workflow to the digital platform with ease.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some concerns on Klinify: Security. Technology rules today’s world. However, the growth of technology has brought about potential incentives for people to expose data. Medical records are meant to be private. In an event of a security breach, millions of medical records can be leaked. However, during the talk, Krish did mention their focus to ensure the safety and privacy of patient records. And only a strong defence system can deter such security compromises.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lomotif">Lomotif</h2>

<p>The second talk was by Paul from Lomotif. Lomotif is essentially a mobile application that allows users to create a video from their stash of videos and even add songs to it. After using it, a clear winning point of Lomotif was the usability factor. It was very simple to use and even a novice mobile user will be able to use it easily. 
Some pointers from Paul:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Market saturation: There will be a point in time when your target market becomes saturated. And Paul mentions that we should definitely anticipate this. To overcome this, we need to try and leverage on another market. I think this can be done in a couple of ways. Various markets are segmented by factors such as age, culture and perception. Hence, an expansion into another market requires a change in the app / technology that addresses one or more of these factors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some interesting features of Lomotif: It’s collaborative, expressive and fun. This fun factor is one of the main reasons which helps Lomotif stand out from its competitors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 Crucial Factors:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Good Team</li>
      <li>Customer Acquisition</li>
      <li>Making your customers happy.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="investing-note">Investing Note</h2>

<p>The third talk was by Shanison from InvestingNote. InvestingNote is a social network site targeted specifically at investors in Singapore and in the regional space.</p>

<p>Upon using the InvestingNote platform, I like the user-friendly interface and the summarised view of stocks/shares and other information. Personally, I believe that such a social-platform can be of great use to investors. Facilitating communication among investors is something new I have seen and if brought about to the target market correctly, I believe this can be a good success.</p>

<p>I feel the above pointers are critical in ensuring the success of the start-up. While it may be true that most start-ups fail eventually, I think keeping the above pointers in mind will definitely aid them to beat the market.</p>

    <p>Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.</p>

<p>The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.</p>

<h3 id="several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as">Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.</li>
  <li>Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.</li>
  <li>Think big, and expand big.</li>
  <li>Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.</li>
  <li>Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).</li>
  <li>With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru">Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:</h3>
<p>The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!</p>

<p>Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.</li>
  <li>Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.</li>
  <li>Size and Valuation</li>
  <li>Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.</li>
  <li>Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.</li>
  <li>A good M&amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.</li>
</ul>

<p>A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble</p>

<p>Some great quotes I found during the presentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”</p>

  <p>“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz">The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:</h3>

<p>Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.</li>
  <li>Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.</li>
  <li>For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.</li>
  <li>Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.</li>
  <li>Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.</li>
  <li>Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.</li>
  <li>Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.</li>
  <li>Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.</li>
  <li>Maximise existing resources to create value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”</p>

  <p>“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”</p>

  <p>“Instead of finding places where there is already competition, find niche areas where you can dominate the business”</p>

  <p>“See opportunities in problems”</p>

  <p>“Get a MVP, or beta model and launch it. Only then you will receive feedback on what the market wants.”</p>

  <p>“Only the paranoid survives” – Quoted from Andrew Grove, Co-Founder of Intel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, a very fruitful session that stirred up the entrepreneur within me. The world needs change, and only innovation can drive that change. And entrepreneurs can lead that innovation. In that regard, I am motivated to become an entrepreneur myself to help make positive difference in the world.</p>

<p>Cheers, <br />
Harish</p>
