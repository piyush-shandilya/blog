	     <p>It has been a hectic semester! Seems like the last time I blogged was before my semester. In NUS they always say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only easy semester was the last semester.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it might be true. I was a little confident that the first semester would have helped me to adjust to the environment and that the second semester will be much easier to cope. Though I have gotten used to the environment, the workload is definitely on the rise.</p>

<p>It is extremely hard to achieve a work-life balance as there is a lot of pressure to give your best. I realise that I can achieve well when I really appreciate and love what I am learning instead of going through the motion of education at college.</p>

<p>Thankfully summer is finally here and I hope to get a good break. I have a lot of mini projects to accomplish this summer.</p>

<p>One of the projects will be Friendezvous, which I am doing for a “module” called Orbital. Please do support me by liking the Facebook page <a href="www.fb.com/ProjectFriendezvous">here.</a></p>

<p>My module reviews for the previous semester are on their way! ;)</p>

<p>Till then,<br />
Cheers</p>
