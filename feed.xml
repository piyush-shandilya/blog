        <title>HTTPS - What&#39;s the Big Deal?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-http&quot;&gt;What is HTTP?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol used by the World Wide Web and it forms the basis for how data is transmitted over the Internet and how servers and browsers respond to various requests. Essentially, it the “procedure” which helps define how data or messages should be exchanged by different parties on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-http&quot;&gt;The Problem with HTTP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Bsb0pyL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with HTTP is that it does not provide for &lt;strong&gt;Integrity, Authentication and Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;. That means data transmitted over HTTP alone is easy to intercept and makes you susceptible to a whole range of attacks which can compromise the 3 factors mentioned above (which you would ideally want when you surf the web).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-about-https&quot;&gt;How about HTTPS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTPS is essentially HTTP running over Secure Socket Layer (SSL). HTTPS works by encrypting the HTTP message before the exchange and when received on the other side, it decrypts the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, if HTTP is used, sensitive information which may be credit card information, your identity numbers, login credentials such as passwords etc. will be transmitted over the server as plaintext. This leaves the exchange vulnerable to “eavesdropping” which means an attacker can intercept the message and use it for harmful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-ssl-certificates-work&quot;&gt;How do SSL Certificates work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a browser/server tries to connect to a webpage secured with SSL, it first requests the web server to identify itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The web server then sends the client or server its SSL certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The browser checks the SSL certificate to know if it can trust it. If it is able to trust the SSL certificate, it sends a message to the web server acknowledge this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The web server is now ready to establish an SSL encyrpted session with the client/server and sends a digital acknowledgement back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now when messages or data is transferred between these 2 entities, they will be encrypted based on a mutually agreed ciphersuite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above process where the browser and web sever initiate a secure session is called an SSL Handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Anyone can create a SSL certificate, but it must be digitally signed by a trusted &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority&quot;&gt;Certification Authority (CA)&lt;/a&gt;. Most computers come with a pre-installed list of CAs they can trust and when the browser checks the SSL certificate, it verifies the digital signature against this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-and-private-keys&quot;&gt;Public and Private Keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would have probably heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography&quot;&gt;asymmetric cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, also known as, public-key cryptography. In this type of asymmetric encryption, two types of keys are involved: public key and private key. The names speak for themselves. Public keys are made public, that is anyone is able to know them. Private keys are private, which means no one other than yourself will be able to access this private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when someone wants to send me some document, they will simply encrypt the document with my public key (which is accessible by anyone and everyone). Then, they send me this document. Now, I just need to use my private key (which is only known to me) to decrypt this. This ensures that only the &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; receipient of the message will be able to decrypt and hence, access the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if I am sending someone my document, I will encrypt the document with my private key. The receipient of the document will now use my public key to decrypt it and access the document. This helps to identify that the document &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; came from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssl-transaction&quot;&gt;SSL Transaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up the SSL session, we need 3 keys: public key, private key and session key. As disucussed above the public and private keys are effective in ensuring that the data is reliable and authentic. However, this requires considerable amount of processing power. Hence, we use the session key to encrypt any transmitted data &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; the SSL handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-ssl-to-your-website&quot;&gt;Adding SSL to your website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add SSL, you will have to first purchase a SSL certificate, activate it, install the certificate and finally configure your site to use the certificate. There are tons of tutorials online on how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get free SSL protection with Cloudflare. To know how you can add free SSL to your website, check &lt;a href=&quot;/blog//Adding-SSL-to-Your-Site-for-Free&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top 5 Protein Sources Vegetarians Need to Know</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Quick Bite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Why an elephant as a cover photo? - The elephant, one of the strongest animals in the animal kingdom, sustains itself on a “vegetarian” diet since it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore&quot;&gt;herbivorous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to eat meat if you’re bodybuilding. Of course, it is easier to find protein from sources such as fish and chicken. But if you’re a vegetarian, you can definitely get your protein source from these amazing vegetarian sources!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;greek-yogurt&quot;&gt;1. Greek Yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite source of protein is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-regular-and-greek-yogurt-ingredient-intelligence-204137&quot;&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;. As compared to regular yogurt, Greek yogurt has a thicker texture as it undergoes extensive straining to remove the liquid and lactose present. This results in double the amount of protein as what regular yogurt contains! Also, Greek yogurt is readily available in most supermarkets and they are fairly priced. 150g of Greek yogurt typically costs anything between USD 1.20 to USD 3.00 depending on the brand and where you purchase it. My favourite is the Emmi Swiss Premium Greek Style Yogurt (Natural) shown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PySI3G4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Greek Yogurt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small tub contains 150g of Greek yogurt, is non-fat and has 10% protein. That is equivalent to 84 calories and 15g of protein. Comparatively, a whey protein shake is about 20g of protein with 122 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like mean, you probably won’t like the yogurt raw. A simple trick is to add a tablespoon of honey (Manuka honey is really good!) to it before consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See here for more benefits of Greek yogurt: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/86488-benefits-greek-yogurt/&quot;&gt;Livestrong.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chickpeas&quot;&gt;2. Chickpeas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/g8VeUHf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chickpeas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chickpeas, also known as grams or garbanzo bean are also rich in protein. Just one cup of chickpeas can provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/528633-the-protein-in-chickpeas/&quot;&gt;12 grams of protein&lt;/a&gt;. Chickpeas can be made easily by soaking it in water overnight or  boiling it. Easy protein for all vegetarians!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike animal protein, chickpeas (and most plant-based proteins) do not have all the amino acids to give the complete protein you need. But, you can easily combine chickpeas with other food to “complete” your protein requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lentils&quot;&gt;3. Lentils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Kfq9yPN.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lentils&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from an Indian family, lentils are commonplace in most of my dishes. They are perfect for anyone to get various nutrients all at one go. One cup of lentils can provide up to 18 grams of protein and contains many other nutrients like iron, potassium and zinc. In fact, lentils are considered to be one of the world’s healthiest foods! Combining lentils with your daily meals is a great way to meet your protein requirements. They are surely a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesweetbeet.com/lentil-nutrients/&quot;&gt;great replacement for fish and meat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;milk&quot;&gt;4. Milk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/bOPP1a0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Milk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milk primarily contains 3-4 types of caseins. Having a glass of milk daily, in the morning can help kickstart your metabolism for the day. You seem to be wondering how much protein there is in a glass of milk. One glass (around 200 ml) can easily provide 10 - 11g of protein with about 120 calories. My daily breakfast consists of a glass of milk with Milo and 2 slices of wholemeal bread. That gives me 17.6g of protein with 368 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuts&quot;&gt;5. Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/DrDjJCx.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nuts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post would not be complete without the mention of nature’s wonders: nuts. Walnuts, almonds, grams, cashews, sunflower seeds, peanuts &lt;em&gt;(beware: high fat content too!)&lt;/em&gt;, pine nuts, pecan nuts. Take a handful of a mix of whichever of these nuts you can find to get a wholesome nutrient source with a good amount of protein! However, some nuts, like peanuts, can also have a high fat content. So do check out the nutritional labels on the fat content for the nuts to decide how much would fit your daily expectations or goals. My favourite combination includes roasted grams, peanuts, almonds and sunflower seeds! I usually like to supplement my workout with a handful of nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why I did not mention soy, which also provides for an excellent source of protein. Protein alone may not give someone the clear and overall picture. In my readings, I have often found that soy, despite being high in proteins, contain phytoestrogens which might disrupt hormone levels. While this is a debatable topic, I prefer to steer away from soy products. There are so many other options which appeal to me more than soy anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this was helpful! Share the goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: Dietary requirements would vary depending on your current health status. Some products mentioned may contain additional ingredients which may not be suitable for all. Do consult a nutritionist to be well-advised.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Singing in the Shower</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;C’mon, I know you do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admit it! You have probably sung in the shower at least once or twice in your life. This so-called phenomenon is know as “Bathroom singing”. It is interesting why many of us love the shower time and particularly why we end up singing during those few minutes of lathering up and showering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intriguing as it sounds, I went to check out the scientific reasons behind this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;showering-makes-us-relaxed&quot;&gt;Showering makes us relaxed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showering helps us relax ourselves. The calm sound of your shower running and the soothing flow of water against your skin helps you to relax yourself. When singing, we often take deep breaths to accomodate the “heavy” parts of the song. These deep breaths in turn help to increase our oxygen flow to the brain. That means further relaxation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extra-dopamine&quot;&gt;Extra dopamine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we relax in the shower, the brain starts secreting the pleasure hormone called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news-medical.net/health/Dopamine-Functions.aspx&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;. Dopamine, in turn, helps us with even more creative rendering of songs. No wonder you sound so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;amazing-acoustics&quot;&gt;Amazing acoustics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showers are usually quite small and the surrounding four walls make a great room for the acoustics of singing. The reverbs and bounce of your voice off the walls makes singing all the better! These sound “effects” helps us hear ourselves and the intricacies of the song clearly, making it sound great at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lone-time--extra-confidence&quot;&gt;Lone time = Extra Confidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet many of you would have seen people who would shy away from singing in the public, yet morph into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Elvis_Presley&quot;&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; in their home showers. After a long day of work or study, showering is the probably the only time which allows us to have some “alone” time. And this great because you don’t have to shy away from anyone, you don’t have to worry about what others would think about your ~~horrible~~ singing. It gives you the time to be who you are and do what you like for that tiny bit of 5-10 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bathrooms seem to have been built for singing. They are awesome avenues to express yourself without worrying about anything else and indeed a great way to bust stress. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa15/2015/10/21/why-do-we-sing-in-the-shower/comment-page-1/&quot;&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that people who consistently sing in the shower benefit from many positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep singing! Who knows? - The next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikipedia.com/en/Ed_Sheeran&quot;&gt;Ed Sheeran&lt;/a&gt; might be born out of the shower! 😂&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting a Free Domain For Students</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are student and you are looking to get a domain, then you’re in luck! You can get one for free with Namecheap. Namecheap provides services such as domain name registration and web hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a free domain, check out their student offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://nc.me/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/AM8g6yo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Namecheap Student Deal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a small catch though. You will only be able to get the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.me&lt;/code&gt; domain for free. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.me&lt;/code&gt; domains are usually used for personal sites and blogs like mine. If you’re looking for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/code&gt; and other domains, then this offer will not apply. Despite that, Namecheap’s domain hosting is extremely affordable and comes in at only a couple of dollars per &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding SSL to Your Site (Free!)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; to host my static websites for several years now. But recently, this error notice worried me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/SSL_error.png&quot; alt=&quot;SSL Error Message&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens when you visit my website, harishv.me, with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; in front. This redirects to &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv.me&quot;&gt;https://harishv.me&lt;/a&gt; and all you will see is this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; as the site is unable to provide a secure connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a normal GitHub Pages site, which means it has a domain that has &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, you can simply go to the GitHub repository you are using, click settings, go all the way down till you see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Enforce HTTPS&lt;/code&gt;. Clicking this will mean that your site will always be served over HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching for free SSL options to add onto my website, I found that you can actually use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare’s&lt;/a&gt; name servers under their free plan to obtain a SSL certificate for your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow Cloudflare to scan your website records&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check and verify that the automatically generated records by Cloudflare matches with those on your registrar’s page (in my case, this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://namecheap.com/&quot;&gt;Namecheap.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloudflare will now give you 2 nameservers to add into your account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login to Namecheap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on Domains List&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the domain you want to add SSL for and click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Manage&lt;/code&gt; at the right side&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under nameservers, copy and paste the 2 nameservers Cloudflare gave you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once done, on Cloudflare’s Overview tab, click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recheck Nameservers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare also offers up to three page rules in the free plan. With this, we can always enforce a `https on our website. To do that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the Page Rule tab at the top in Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter this: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://*&amp;lt;your-domain-name&amp;gt;.com/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the settings to be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Always Use HTTPS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Save and Deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The asterisks are like wildcard patterns which means any URLs entered in that format will be enforced to utilise HTTPS connection. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;www.harishv.me&quot;&gt;www.harishv.me&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me/blog&quot;&gt;http://harishv.me/blog&lt;/a&gt; will all now be enforced with HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks. Get your free SSL certificate with Cloudflare now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you’re wondering why is HTTPS that big of a deal, wait a few days for my next article on HTTPS - What’s the Big Deal?.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scales in Music Theory</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Scales are commonplace in music theory. We can consider a scale to be a set of notes within one octave. In fact, all the popular songs we listen to use scales in one way or another. In music pieces, we may see different sections of the songs being written in different keys. For example, the first section can be in the key of F, because it resolves or concludes on the F note/chord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whole-and-half-steps&quot;&gt;Whole and Half Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we see what scales are, we need to understand what are half steps and whole steps. To put it simply, a half step is the distance between 2 consecutive notes on the keyboard. So a half step from C gives us C#. A half step from E gives us F (there is no black key between E and F).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A whole step is just made up of 2 half steps. So a whole step from C gives us D and a whole step from E gives us F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-major-scale&quot;&gt;The Major Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most common scale you will be seeing. We can construct the major scale with a simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;w-w-h-w-w-w-h&quot;&gt;W W h W W W h&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this easily with an example. Taking the simplest C major scale, we start off with the note C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c---d---e---f---g---a---b---c&quot;&gt;C -&amp;gt; D -&amp;gt; E -&amp;gt; F -&amp;gt; G -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; B -&amp;gt; C&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/C_Major_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;C Major Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From C to D, D to E we have taken a whole step. Then we take a half step from E to F. From F to G, G to A, and A to B, we have taken a whole step. And finally, with one more half step, we go back to C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B are all in the C major scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more example. Let’s look at the scale F# major. So, we start with the note of F#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f--gb---g--ab---a--bb---b---c--db---d--eb---e--f---f&quot;&gt;F# / Gb -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; B -&amp;gt; C# / Db -&amp;gt; D# / Eb -&amp;gt; E# / F -&amp;gt; F&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/FSharp_Major_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;F# Major Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So F# major scale has 6 sharps in total and contains the notes: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#. Note that musically, E# is just equivalent to F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-minor-scale&quot;&gt;The Minor Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three different types of minor scales: natural, harmonic and melodic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-natural-minor-scale&quot;&gt;The Natural Minor Scale&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for deriving the natural minor scale from the root note is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;w-h-w-w-h-w-w&quot;&gt;W h W W h W W&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the above examples of the major scale, we can apply this formula to know which notes compose the natural minor scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example: F Natural Minor scale. So, we will start with the note of F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f---g---g--ab---a--bb---c---c--db---d--eb---f&quot;&gt;F -&amp;gt; G -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; C -&amp;gt; C# / Db -&amp;gt; D# / Eb -&amp;gt; F&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/F_Minor_Natural_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;F Natural Minor Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-harmonic-minor-scale&quot;&gt;The Harmonic Minor Scale&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much difference between the natural minor and harmonic minor, except that you will need to increase the seventh note in the scale by a half step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen above, the F Harmonic Minor Scale will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f---g---g--ab---a--bb---c---c--db---e---f&quot;&gt;F -&amp;gt; G -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; C -&amp;gt; C# / Db -&amp;gt; E -&amp;gt; F&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/F_Harmonic_Minor_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;F Harmonic Minor Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since D# / Eb is the seventh note in the scale of F minor natural, we increase it by a half step to E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-melodic-minor-scale&quot;&gt;The Melodic Minor Scale&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding onto the harmonic minor scale, for the melodic minor scale, we simply increase both the sixth and seventh notes of the natural minor scale by a half step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the F Melodic Minor Scale will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f---g---g--ab---a--bb---c---d---e---f&quot;&gt;F -&amp;gt; G -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; C -&amp;gt; D -&amp;gt; E -&amp;gt; F&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/F_Melodic_Minor_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;F Melodic Minor Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# / Db and D# / Eb were the sixth and seventh notes of the F natural minor respectively. Increasing both by a half step will give us D and E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pentatonic-scales&quot;&gt;Pentatonic Scales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentatonic scales, as the name suggests, are scales containing 5 notes. There are essentially 2 forms of pentatonic scales and yes you guessed it right, the major and minor pentatonic scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-pentatonic-scales&quot;&gt;Major Pentatonic Scales&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, both the major and minor scales contain 7 notes in one octave. For the major pentatonic scale, we will just be using the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th notes from the natural major scale. In other words, simply exclude the 4th and 7th notes from the major scale to get the corresponding pentatonic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the C major pentatonic scale looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c---d---e---g---a&quot;&gt;C -&amp;gt; D -&amp;gt; E -&amp;gt; G -&amp;gt; A&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/C_Major_Pentatonic_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;C Major Pentatonic Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F# major pentatonic scale looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f-gb---g--ab---a--bb---c--db---d--eb&quot;&gt;F# /Gb -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; C# / Db -&amp;gt; D# / Eb&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minor-pentatonic-scales&quot;&gt;Minor Pentatonic Scales&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the minor pentatonic scales, we only include the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th notes of the natural minor scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F minor pentatonic scale will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;f---g--ab---a--bb---c---d--eb&quot;&gt;F -&amp;gt; G# / Ab -&amp;gt; A# / Bb -&amp;gt; C -&amp;gt; D# / Eb&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/scales/F_Minor_Pentatonic_Scale.png&quot; alt=&quot;F Minor Pentatonic Scale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hosting with GitHub Pages</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can host websites with GitHub Pages? In fact, so far, all my websites have been hosted with GitHub Pages. See my &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/projects&quot;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;. All the websites there under the domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me&quot;&gt;harishv.me&lt;/a&gt; are hosted under GitHub Pages. And of course, my homepage, and even this blog you are reading now are hosted on GitHub Pages. Let’s see why is it so awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-great-stuff&quot;&gt;The Great Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-free&quot;&gt;1. It’s free!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages offers free hosting of your websites/apps etc. That’s right, its totally free. (There’s a catch though, check the limitations below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;connected-to-your-git-repository&quot;&gt;2. Connected to your Git repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control is crucial for any project you do. GitHub Pages is connected with your GitHub repository, which means once any changes are pushed, your website is automatically rebuilt and deployed for you. The individual sub-pages that see - &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me/blog/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me/projects/&quot;&gt;my projects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me/photography/&quot;&gt;my photography page&lt;/a&gt; are all individual GitHub repositories. The main page is a GitHub repository named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;your-github-username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch. To deploy other repositories under your GitHub Pages domain, you simply push your changes to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;custom-domain-names&quot;&gt;3. Custom domain names&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default GitHub Pages offers the domain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&amp;lt;your-github-username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This is good enough for many hobbyists to try deploying their local projects on the web. But if you want a custom domain, you can do that too. Simply register for a domain name on sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://namecheap.com/&quot;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://godaddy.com/&quot;&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt; and connect them to GitHub pages. My site domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me&quot;&gt;harishv.me&lt;/a&gt; is registered on Namecheap and connected to my GitHub repositories. If you want to see how I connected my Namecheap domain with GitHub Pages, check &lt;a href=&quot;/blog//Connecting-Namecheap-Domain-with-GitHub&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jekyll-blogging-support&quot;&gt;4. Jekyll blogging support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, which means you can create blogs and deploy them. Jekyll is a powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;-based blogging tool. All you need to do is run a few Jekyll commands after writing your posts and Jekyll builds static sites which you can easily push to GitHub. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv.me/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; is built with Jekyll as well. It’s a great way for people who prefer pure code-style of blogging. Also, all your posts can be easily backed up as they are all in a text-based Markdown format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-uptime&quot;&gt;5. Great Uptime&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is almost always up with some rare cases of downtime. This means that it provides reliable service in ensuring your webpages are live 99% of the time. That’s one huge bonus for a free service. You can check on the GitHub system status &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.github.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rather short section since there aren’t many disadvantages I can think of. There are rather limitations with GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;only-hosts-static-sites&quot;&gt;1. Only Hosts Static Sites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While its true that GitHub Pages offers free hosting, it does not support full-fledged dynamic sites. Rather you can only host static sites which means they are in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Essentially, there is no server-side support where you can for example do database-related operations etc. Nevertheless, this alone is powerful enough for some projects. All my pure front-end based projects are hosted with GitHub Pages. I have made many of those with the combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, libraries such as ReactJS and jQuery, and frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;only-supports-github-repositories&quot;&gt;2. Only supports GitHub repositories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, GitHub only supports repositories from itself. If you use another platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/&quot;&gt;Atlassian BitBucket&lt;/a&gt; for version control then you will not be able to utilise GitHub Pages. If you are using BitBucket, you are in luck since they too offer support for hosting static sites.  Check this &lt;a href=&quot;https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html&quot;&gt;FAQ section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecting Namecheap Domain with GitHub Pages</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A basic tutorial for those who are looking to connect their custom domain to GitHub Pages. This post assumes you will be getting your domain with Namecheap. But, it should mostly apply to any domain providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first used Namecheap because they offered students free domains. Yup, if you are a student you can get a free Namecheap domain ending with `.me’ free for a year. Check their offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://nc.me/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;register-on-namecheap&quot;&gt;1. Register on Namecheap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namecheap.com/&quot;&gt;Namecheap homepage&lt;/a&gt; and register for an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;select-a-cool-domain&quot;&gt;2. Select a cool domain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to get a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; domain. It is the most general and commonly used domain. But with a ton of websites floating online, you may not be able to find your ideal domain available under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt;. If thats the case check out &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.me&lt;/code&gt; domains for a personal website (like mine), the trendy &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.io&lt;/code&gt; for a startup/business, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt;. Namecheap offers a wide range of domains to choose from. Some of them are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.life&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.co&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tech&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the domain carefully as you will be sticking with it for some considerable time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-a-github-repository&quot;&gt;3. Get a GitHub Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet created a repository, go to GitHub to create one. Name it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;your-github-username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; and ensure you have a master branch where you can push your HTML files. I assume you have your HTML, CSS, JavaScript files ready. Push them to this repository on the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit the website &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;your-github-username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; should allow you to view the expected website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-a-cname-record-in-your-repository&quot;&gt;4. Create a CNAME record in your Repository&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a file titled CNAME with your domain name. That’s it. For example my CNAME file contains this:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;harishv.me&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;go-to-namecheaps-dashboard&quot;&gt;5. Go to Namecheap’s Dashboard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Advanced DNS section, add in the following records. The CNAME record’s value  follows the GitHub URL you made in step 3. The A records are used to point the domain name to the IP address of the hosting server, which in your case will be GitHub’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/posts/namecheap_records.png&quot; alt=&quot;Namecheap Records&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all folks. Give it a few minutes (or hours) and your site will be live at your newly registered domain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Questions Every Business Must Answer</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel&quot;&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known entrepreneur, political activist and philanthropist shares the seven questions a business needs to answer in his bestseller book, Zero to One. Getting at least 5-6 questions correct might help in ensuring the success of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt it was indeed crucial for any to-be-entrepreneurs to think about these questions before they embark on their start-up mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-engineering-question&quot;&gt;1. The Engineering Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-timing-question&quot;&gt;2. The Timing Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Is now the right time to start your particular business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-monopoly-question&quot;&gt;3. The Monopoly Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you starting with a big share of a small market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-people-question&quot;&gt;4. The People Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you have the right team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-distribution-question&quot;&gt;5. The Distribution Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-durability-question&quot;&gt;6. The Durability Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-secret-question&quot;&gt;7. The Secret Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Thiel mentions that often people try to start a company and just hope for a miracle of success to happen. However, the true success of a start-up occurs when there’s a right mix of a few elements that forms a strong foundation of the company. The right mix happens when the above questions are answered, each with a ‘Yes’.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Have a Dream</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sharing one of the most inspiring speeches in human history - ‘I have a dream’, by Martin Luther King Jr. Even today when I read or watch this, I am truly inspired by the passion Martin Luther King Jr. shows when he speaks every single word with conviction. What an amazing leader!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot walk alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: “For Whites Only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest – quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” – one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;strong&gt;dream&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this will be the day – this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From every mountainside, let freedom ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free at last! Free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An American pastor, activist, humanitarian. People know him for leading the African-American Civil Rights movement using nonviolent civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top Todo App of 2016</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a multitude of todo apps nowadays. Finding the right tool to keep your day organised is rather an individual choice - but there are definitely some apps which outshine others in terms of their features. The best apps offer advanced features such as notifications, reminders, lists and sublists and the list goes on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wunderlist&quot;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/vmpiDq5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wunderlist Main Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vote for the best Todo application goes to Wunderlist. The name Wunderlist may be rather familiar to you considering it has been around since 2011. Though Wunderlist adopts a freemium model, I can safely say that the free version itself has plentiful of features that can satisfy any average user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of Wunderlist is its multi-platform support. The app is available on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle and Chromebook. Wunderlist also offers extensions on your favourite browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. No matter where you are, you are always in sync. Add something on your Mac and it immediately shows up on your mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/2OEZVgz.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wunderlist ToDo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second feature that makes Wunderlist the right tool for you is reminders. For every task that you add, you can specify both the due date and a reminder. This is my most used feature of Wunderlist as reminders ensure I am up to all my tasks even when I am not checking the app. Reminders are offered via the app as well as a personal email sent right to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todos added can also be specified to be recurring (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or custom basis) and it is really simple to keep track of repeating tasks. Under each todo, Wunderlist also offers the support to add sub-tasks and notes. One thing the app does not offer is priority levels. You can also star important tasks which you can use to signify the priority. For more levels of priority, you can create individual priority lists and assign tasks to those. Alternatively, my recommendation is use Wunderlist tags. By appending “#tag_name” to tasks we can tag the task under a certain category. For priority levels for example, we can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#high&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#medium&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#low&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge plus of Wunderlist is its collaborative feature. I personally love using this feature whenever I am travelling with my friends or family. I simply create a shared list and all my friends or family members can easily edit the lists. They can also comment on the tasks I have added, making communication across the app really simple and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the free version of Wunderlist and the Pro version is not stark, but it may make a difference for power users. Under the free version, we can add up to 5mb of files as attachments to tasks, assign up to 25 people, create up to 25 subtasks and choose from 20 backgrounds. The Pro version offers unlimited file size, assignments, subtasks and up to 30 backgrounds to choose from. Wunderlist Pro costs $4.99/month, but it seems that the basic or free version will easily satisfy the average user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the following link to Amazon for more information on Wunderlist, as well as a cool book which details Wunderlist for Writers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;OneJS=1&amp;amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;source=ac&amp;amp;ref=tf_til&amp;amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;amp;tracking_id=harishv7-20&amp;amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;amp;region=US&amp;amp;placement=B01DICYKRU&amp;amp;asins=B01DICYKRU&amp;amp;linkId=955dd407043325294afff9cffcfc76bf&amp;amp;show_border=false&amp;amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&amp;amp;price_color=333333&amp;amp;title_color=0066c0&amp;amp;bg_color=ffffff&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wunderlist’s features and great looking user interface certainly makes it one of the most compelling todo apps today. Use it and let us know your comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top Email Clients for the New Mac</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-mail&quot;&gt;Apple Mail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/hm3hIAU.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Mail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/yos_mail_conversations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Mail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s built in client, Mail, offers a neat interface for managing multiple email accounts at once. From experience, it integrates smoothly with all the popular service providers such as Google, Yahoo, Outlook and Office Enterprise accounts. It also offers markup capabilities to edit your PDF or image attachment right within the client. Spotlight on macOS also includes Mail attachments and emails into search. Mail comes installed by default on all new Macs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spark&quot;&gt;Spark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sparkmailapp.com/img/new/index/all_devices.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spark&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spark won “Best of 2016” award. Spark places itself as a client for users looking productivity. It has a Smart Inbox which allows you to focus on the most important emails by categorising new emails into  Personal, Notifications and Newsletters. Spark’s snooze feature helps you to get rid of emails that are not urgent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/hZ07VF2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Smart Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite feature of Spark is its smart search that support natural language. If you are looking for attachments from John, your colleague, simply typing “attachments from John” will bring the relevant results to you in an instant. Spark offers smart notifications, which helps you filter email notifications to only those of high priority. Signature support is also great in Spark as you just need to quickly swipe or choose between your frequently used signatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spark offers an “Undo Send” feature which allows a delay of 5 seconds before sending the email. This may be useful for those who often send hurried emails as you can stop sending the email and continue edits. However, currently Spark does not allow for variable delay and it is fixed to 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that really stands out in Spark is its Quick Replies. You can quickly reply to any email with a preset of emotions such as Like, Thanks, Agree etc. And beyond all the hoard of features, Spark has a great UI that keeps you coming back to it. Spark comes free on both the Mac App Store for Macs and the iTunes Store for iOS devices. It’s definitely worth a try for all new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;airmail&quot;&gt; Airmail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/kAhWBrC.png&quot; alt=&quot;Airmail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a loyal user of Airmail for about two years now. I made the switch from Apple’s Mail to Airmail primarily because of the Snooze function it offerred back then. At that time, Airmail seemed to be the best option as other alternatives (such as Spark) were not present. But a word of warning is that Airmail offers tons of preferences and settings which may not be for the average user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Spark, Airmail has many of the features discussed. I personally like the “Undo Send” function which offers up to 120 seconds delay before sending an email which you clicked Send. It has already proved to be a crucial function in several scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgur.com/faZx1p1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown - Airmail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airmail contains several themes which may appeal to different individuals. Also, Airmail offers crafting emails in Markdown, a popular language for blogging nowadays. It provides a immediate preview of the email by having a split screen view. With Markdown, you can easily create lists, and even embed your code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airmail supports integrations with several productivity apps such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calendar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reminders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Todoist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and many others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Airmail is not free, it comes at an affordable price of US$9.99.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Markdown?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a markup language that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats. The best part of Markdown is that you can write it in plaintext format, yet format it using certain special characters such as hyphens (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), quotes etc. Even this post was rendered with Markdown. Let’s see how we can craft posts with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;headings&quot;&gt;Headings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to HTML, Markdown supports six levels of headings, from H1 to H6. To achieve different headings, we simply use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; to denote the level. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;# Hello&lt;/code&gt; yields a H1 header while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;## Hello&lt;/code&gt; yields a H2 header. Here’s a demo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;h1-header&quot;&gt;H1 header&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h2-header&quot;&gt;H2 header&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h3-header&quot;&gt;H3 header&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;h4-header&quot;&gt;H4 header&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;h5-header&quot;&gt;H5 header&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;h6-header&quot;&gt;H6 header&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bold-italics-underline-and-strikethrough&quot;&gt;Bold, Italics, Underline and Strikethrough&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give sufficient emphasis we can use the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```markdown
Text can be made bold by using a &lt;strong&gt;double asterisks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;double underscores&lt;/strong&gt; at both the start and end of the text segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text can be made italics by using a single asterisk or single underscore at both the start and end of the text segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combine both bold and italics, we can use both the above notations like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a strikethrough, we can use two tildes at the start and end of the text segment ~~like this~~.
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text can be made bold by using a &lt;strong&gt;double asterisks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;double underscores&lt;/strong&gt; at both the start and end of the text segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text can be made italics by using a single asterisk or single underscore at both the start and end of the text segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combine both bold and italics, we can use both the above notations like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a strikethrough, we can use two tildes at the start and end of the text segment ~~like this~~.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-lists&quot;&gt;Making Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists are one of the most needed features for anyone writing anything! Markdown offers a nifty feature for making lists that is super easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ordered-numbered-lists&quot;&gt;Ordered (Numbered) Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make numbered lists, we simply start with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; and markdown interprets whatever comes after as the first point of the list. You can create nested lists with three spaces followed by a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
1. Hello World
2. This is a numbered list.
   3. This is a nested numbered list.
&lt;/code&gt;
The above gives us the following result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hello World&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a numbered list.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a nested numbered list.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unordered-lists&quot;&gt;Unordered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make unordered lists, we can use asterisks (*), minuses (-), pluses (+).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
* Unordered point 1
+ Unordered point 2
- Unordered point 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above will now translate to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unordered point 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unordered point 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unordered point 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combining-ordered-and-unordered-lists&quot;&gt;Combining Ordered and Unordered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combine and nest ordered and unordered lists, we just need to add trailing spaces before the next point followed by a number/asterisk/minus/plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
1. Ordered point 1
2. Ordered point 2
   * Unordered point nested under point 2
3. Ordered point 3
   1. Ordered point 1 under point 3
&lt;/code&gt;
Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordered point 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordered point 2
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unordered point nested under point 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordered point 3
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ordered point 1 under point 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-links&quot;&gt;Adding Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinks are one of the most commonly used features in any document, blog etc. Adding links in Markdown is really simple too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a hyperlink on a text, we use both square brackets &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and round brackets &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we put the text we want to hyperlink into the square brackets, in this example, Google: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Google]&lt;/code&gt;. Next, we hyperlink by adding the actual web address in between round brackets right after the square brackets, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
[Google](http://www.google.com)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rendering the markdown, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-images&quot;&gt;Adding Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding images is very similar to adding links. All we need to do is to add an exclamation mark in front of the square brackets. The alt text for the image goes into the square brackets and web address into the round brackets. Suppose we want to display the Google logo, we do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
![Google Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/2000px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this renders as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg/2000px-Google_2015_logo.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockquotes&quot;&gt;Blockquotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockquotes are handy to specify sections which have been to quoted from another source. They are commonly used in emails where you can highlight the point you are addressing with regards to a previous email. To add a block quote, you use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
&amp;gt; This is a blockquote.
&amp;gt; This is the second line of the blockquote.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote.
This is the second line of the blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-code&quot;&gt;Adding Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown supports adding code and syntax-highlighting. This is a joy for any programmer or developer. I am personally a heavy user of this feature to make my notes/articles. To add a code block, we wrap the code with three backticks: “```” .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a general code block as there is no language specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add code blocks by specifying the language as well. We do this by adding the language name right after the first “```”. For example, lets add a Python code block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot; data-lang=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;python
def print_hello_world():
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    
print_hello_world();
&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the above renders into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hello_world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hello_world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Markdown supports an astonishing variety of languages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you just want to highlight a specific word like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;. That’s called inline code. To add inline code, we just use one backtick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot; data-lang=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`inline code`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gives us &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inline code&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-tables&quot;&gt;Adding Tables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, there is support for adding tables too! Now you can easily add tables with markdown to all your emails instead of creating them elsewhere and painstakingly copying them over to ensure in-tact formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use fences to make tables in markdown. A typical markdown table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;markdown
| Fruits    | Cost   | Quantity  | Total |Supplier   |
| :-------- |-------:| ---------:|------:|:---------:|
| Apples    | $2     |   160     |$320   |XYZ Company|
| Oranges   | $3     |   120     |$360   |ABC Company|
| Pears     | $4     |   100     |$400   |123 Company|
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colons help us align the content within the columns. You can also add emphasis (bold, italics, strikethrough) in the tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Fruits&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Apples&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;160&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$320&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;XYZ Company&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Oranges&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$360&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ABC Company&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pears&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;123 Company&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can it is a really neat way to make tables! Placing the colon on either sides of the dividing line indicates how the content for the column will be aligned. Colon on left helps left-align (see column &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fruits&lt;/code&gt;). Colon on the right helps right-align (see columns &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Total&lt;/code&gt;). Colons on both sides centers the column’s content (see column &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontal-line-breaks&quot;&gt;Horizontal Line Breaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have horziontal lines as dividers, we can use three asterisks (*), hyphens (-) or underscores (_).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot; data-lang=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;Horizontal line 1:
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;
***
&lt;/span&gt;
Horizontal line 2:
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;
---
&lt;/span&gt;
Horizontal line 3:
&lt;span class=&quot;ge&quot;&gt;__&lt;/span&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;renders as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal line 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal line 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal line 3:
___&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it folks! Markdown is a handy and simply language to learn that can help to save loads of time for plaintext lovers. Already planning on which Markdown editor to use?

        <title>NUS Third Year | First Semester in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2&gt; CG3207: Computer Architecture &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CG3207 was one of the most informative, educational modules I have taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module answered many of the questions which was always running in my head: “How computers function so smoothly managing several tasks simultaneously?”, “How do the building blocks of computers actually come together in building a computer?”, “How does a processor function?” etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, it was definitely and undoubtedly a challenging module. It requires some fine skills in Assembly and Verilog/VHDL. The course structure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15% Quiz (3 quizzes, Happens during lecture itself)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;45% Labs (Comprises 4 Lab Projects - 1 individual, 3 group)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;40% Finals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 quizzes which occurs during the lecture period itself. They mostly comprise simple questions which test your understanding of 2-3 chapters. The challenging part comes during the labs which take up significant amount of time. Each of the group project are linked which eventually results in a complete processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finals consists of several short-answer questions with a slight emphasis on the last few chapters: Arithmetic for Computers, Memory System Principles, Pipelining, Advanced Processor Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great module. Challenging due to the time involvement for the various group projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG3002: Embedded Systems Design Project &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of signature modules in Computer Engineering. This design project, done in a group of six, is really heavy in terms of the time commitment it requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we were required to build a &lt;strong&gt;indoor&lt;/strong&gt; navigation system for the visually challenged. We were given some equipment to begin with such as Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi (version 1), sensors (infrared, ultrasound etc.), IMU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely a new experience for me in putting together software and hardware to achieve an embedded system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading is split into a few checkpoints with the two of the milestones as the major component. This project is definitely not something which can be done by one or two people. Every member in your group must be fully involved, cooperative and motivated to complete the project due to the several tight deadlines you will encounter along the way. Coupled with deadlines from other modules, my team (along with other teams) spent several days staying late at college (sometimes overnight too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of advice for team formation is to have members specialised in various fields such as software, hardware and firmware. It’s crucial to have a kind of leader who can manage deadlines aptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great experience in building the project despite the various tight deadlines which spiked our stress levels at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EG2401: Engineering Professionalism &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module mainly serves to build upon the professional work ethics an engineer should uphold in his/her career. There are 4 main sections revolving around the topics of ethical theories, academic research ethics, plagiarism and professional code, engineering and environmental concerns &amp;amp; intellectual property (copyrights, patents, trademarks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is graded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continual Assessment - 50% (Tutorial Participation - 20%, Research Project - 30%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam - 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, the module has an extra emphasis on the participation during tutorials. The research project mainly involves some research on current fields/topics on engineering with an analysis of the ethics involved in those fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam (closed-book) consists of some structured and essay questions covering the various concepts/practices etc. taught during lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a relatively manageable module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS3244: Machine Learning &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the modules I looked forward most. Though it was pretty different from what I expected, it was somewhat enriching in providing a good overview and understanding of what the field of machine learning is all about and how it is used widely in almost every aspect of our technologies today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the significant amount of math involved in this field initially. The math involved mostly Calculus and Linear Algebra. Coming from a Computer Engineering background I was not very familiar with the parts on Linear Algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester machine learning was widely revised under the new professor Prof Kan Min Yen. Prof Min mentioned this syllabus is vastly different from the what was taught in previous semesters. There was equal emphasis on both theory and practical aspects of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof Min followed the content taught at Caltech by Prof Abu Mostafa. It was easy to revise lecture content by watching the Caltech lectures available on YouTube for most of the chapters. The grading of the module comprises the following components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Homework assignments (2 written @ 10%, 1 programming mini project @ 15%): 35%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participation (via IVLE forums, tutorials): 5%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam: 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a challenging module due to the math involved as well as the abstract concepts which take some amount of time to understand and appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE3204: Computer Networks &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module mainly serves as an introduction to computer networks and their developments over the past few decades. The module is divided into 2 main parts by 2 lecturers. Part 1 focuses on introduction of network concepts and ethernet layer. Part 2 covers majorly on the transport and network layers of OSI network architecture and TCP/IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this module to be pretty interesting as it explained how the Internet, something we depend upon for our daily activities, actually functions. The module was graded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socket Programming Lab (20%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm 1 (15%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Midterm 2 (15%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Exam (50%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module was pretty manageable. Consistency in keeping up with lecture topics was an important factor to do well in the exams and labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheet available &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obclFxSDBXdENRVjA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester was a test of my time-management, leadership skills and determination. Managing the workload of the various modules together with the application for ATAP/Industrial Attachment was definitely not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to my 6 months internship next semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Asynchronous Programming in Node.JS</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine a restaurant reservation application where 10 people are trying to book at the same time. It will be really inconvenient if the 10th person has wait for the 9 others to finish their bookings first. The database calls can take considerable amount of time. With asynchronous programming, we can run multiple requests at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of running things one by one, we can use the concepts of callbacks and promises to have our code to do something while something else is happening. For example, when one user has submitted his booking, while this request is being processed on the backend, the web application can service another request from the next user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple demo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider this program (app.js):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ONE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;TWO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node app.js&lt;/code&gt; will print this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TWO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s replace this code in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ONE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;TWO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this now prints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;TWO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates asynchronous programming with callbacks. The function inside setTimeout is the callback function after the 1000 milliseconds have passed. During this 1000 milliseconds, the program continues on to execute the next instruction which is to log “TWO” to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ReactJS Workshop</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the pleasure of conducting the 3rd Hackerschool workshop in the series on React JS. React is an amazing UI library (commonly misunderstood as a framework). Unlike a framework that typically deals with all the 3 main areas of Model, View and Controller layers (see my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog//MVC-Design-Pattern&quot;&gt;MVC post&lt;/a&gt;, React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought React is just one of another Javascript framework or library that pops up and fades away. But no, React is just amazing and it’s popularity has been growing ever since it’s release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know why, you can check out one of the many React tutorials out there. In the workshop, I basically covered a simple todo app which can be built with ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop materials are available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/reactjs&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/reactjs/#/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try and write the tutorial out as a blog post sometime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time, &lt;br /&gt;
Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish V&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NUS Second Year | Second Semester in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2&gt; CS2010: Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms II &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is one of my favourite modules in this semester. Usually CS2010 is taught by Prof Steven Halim, but it was Dr Brown this semester who is teaching this module for the first time in NUS. Dr Brown was really great and funny as well. He tried to bring across the concepts taught very well and in my opinion one of the coolest professors I have seen. Once I required an extension to one of the important lab assignments and he was so chill about it and totally understands students’ positions. Also, this is a must-take module for any computer science person as it introduces the key algorithms that has made the tech world around us possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course weight he is divided into assignments, labs, lecture quizzes, mid term and final exams. Yes, the weightage is pretty diversified across the various components. It’s important to be consistent in this module as the further weightage for each lab or assignment would also vary depending on the difficulty. The rough breakdown of the course weightage is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In-lecture exercises (8%) – Mini-assignments done during lecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lab exercises (12%) – Similar to assignments but shorter and easier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four Assignments (40%) – Weighted differently depending on difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exams (40%) – Midterm + Final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course structure is basically an introduction to trees, heaps, hash tables in the first half followed by a heavy focus on graphs in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great and crucial module to take for  any computer science or engineering student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2024: Programming for Computer Interfaces &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module was one of the heaviest, if not, the heaviest module I have ever taken. The course mainly focuses on Assembly language in the first half and low-level C programming for computer interfaces in the second half. Both halves consist of a related project done in pairs. While the first project is largely manageable, the second project is huge and is extremely time intensive. In fact, I don’t remember doing anything other than this module in the last 3-4 weeks of the semester. My partner and myself came to NUS at 10am and left at 10pm daily for these weeks. It was an extremely challenging period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip for projects is to 1) Start early &amp;amp; 2) Use the resources around you to learn fully (both online &amp;amp; offline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this module is definitely useful as it gives great in depth understanding of how devices around us were programmed and interfaced, the content was so heavy that I couldn’t get enough time to appreciate everything I learnt. Nevertheless, the module helped me understand the importance of several technologies such as UART, master-slave protocols etc and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were slightly hard as expected. Nevertheless, Prof Rajesh went through all the past year papers one by one during the last few weeks as solutions to the papers are not released. That really helped to clarify a lot of the learning gaps and also on the expectations for the final paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2271: Real-Time Operating Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a great module. Took this under Prof Tulika. This is actually the CEG counterpart module of the CS version of Operating Systems. Hence most of the focus was on the lower level areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is structured into labs, midterms and finals. Also, there is a small component for tutorial attendance. Most of the earlier labs are manageable. However, as we moved along into the later parts, I found the labs to be harder not because of the concepts but mostly the debugging of programs and identifying where we went wrong. Hence, it became a little time-intensive too. Labs are done in pairs using a Spark fun (Arduino) kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending lectures (or watching webcasts) is important to help in the understanding. I actually enjoyed this module quite a bit. And after the module was completed, I began appreciating the use of many of the concepts I have learnt. Concepts such as semaphores, mutexes are so crucial and they are being used everywhere around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exams were pretty hard as compared to the midterms, but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; ST2334: Statistics &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics is a useful and slightly easier than the other modules I took this semester. However, easier means others will also find it easy. I guess the competition for the module was a little high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes were pretty self explanatory out of the times and there are plenty of problems to practice. Both midterms and final exams were pretty okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Module structure is mostly based on IVLE quizzes, tutorial attendance, tutorial participation, midterms and finals. Important tip for this module is to be consistent. And the lecturer did make sure we are consistent by giving online quizzes each week and tutorials on alternate weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obZ0RWQkJGYUlLOVE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1oba2UyN2QzRFVRaVU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: B+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CG2023: Signals &amp;amp; Systems &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals and Systems was an intimidating module for me at first. Looking at so much math and complex terms didn’t help in motivating myself to study. However as time went by, I realised it wasn’t that hard after all. The only requirement to do well in this module is the investment of time. Understanding of the concepts comes over time and dedication  to read the notes again and again. Do this till you understand. Whenever I felt unsure, I used the recommended textbook to write down a few problems and solve then to check my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For midterms and finals, it is very crucial to practice a lot of the past year papers to clarify on the difficulty level and on what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professors were also kind and helpful whenever we approach them with questions. For this module, we just need the discipline to sit down and invest some time in the understanding of the concepts taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the mid-terms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obc0NZNUp5T0JoSnM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheets I used for the final exams are &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVKyZQM1obMk5kWU5mdk1LM0E&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆☆☆☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, it was the most hectic semester I’ve had. Till next time, cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harish V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Science Student Challenge 2016 Experience</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-challenge--our-product&quot;&gt;About the Challenge &amp;amp; Our Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the Data Science Student Challenge which was co-organised and sponsored by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took part in this event together with my friends Alvian, Chris &amp;amp; Ida. We worked tirelessly over just 24 hours to build a full-fledged working application which integrates the concepts of machine learning and data science. And the result of our effort was “Prosper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following extract is from our Github page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Resale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Forecaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;essentially&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;predict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;future&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;resale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Sounds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exciting?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;developed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;National&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;University&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Mircosoft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Prosper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;managed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;among&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dozens&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;teams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;NUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are some screenshots of the application. You can download and give Prosper a try &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/Prosper/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experience&quot;&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was extremely tiring, it was really a fulfilling experience. In that intense 24 hours, I actually learnt so much skills. It also proved that to learn something new, we only needed the determination and the dedication to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alvian has always been interested in the topics of data science and machine learning. Naturally, he was able to lead our discussion and ideas prior to the building of the actual application. I was in charge of developing the desktop client to communicate with the APIs provided by Microsoft Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried using simple AJAX calls through a website. However, it did not work due to some error relating to the blockage of “Cross-Origin Requests”. After about 2 hours and going through multiple StackOverflow questions, we decided to change track. I never thought my experience in a previous module, CS2103 Software Engineering, will help me. I used the good old legacy language Java as it was stable and what everyone in my team knew best. Our technology stack was essentially JavaFX to design the layout the GUI and pure Java for the backend logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ida and Chris helped me and Alvian to get the building of the application done. Meanwhile, Alvian started training the model for our app with the data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.gov.sg/developer&quot;&gt;https://data.gov.sg/developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting through the initial round, my team was selected for the finals where we had to present to a panel of judges. It was really a tough experience. Imagine 24 hours++ without sleep and still needing the energy to be able to present lively to the audience in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we did not obtain the top 3 prizes, I was definitely overjoyed to have my team in the 5th place considering that we were all just sophomores in NUS without much experience in these field. I definitely look forward to participating in the next challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ask NOC - Honestbee &amp; Shopback Sharing Session</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I attended 2 talks during askNOC. There were two invited guests: Jonathan Low from Honestbee and Henry Chan from Shopback. Both companies are startups, having only been in the market for around a year or so. Today’s sharing was largely focused on their business and how they overcame the various challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestbee is a concierge and online delivery service for grocery shopping. So essentially, customers can place orders online for groceries or items found at common supermarkets such as NTUC. The ‘bees’ from the company are actuallly people who will shop the necessary items and deliver them to you in an hour. I personally found this a great idea for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is a huge incentive for consumers to use this product because there are no additional costs. The items are bought at the same prevailing price at the supermarket. Secondly, consumers can order from the convenience of their home. Thirdly, as mentioned by Jonathan, this is an asset light model. There are no storage or warehouse involved. Every purchase is made directly at the supermarket which means storage is well taken care of. Essentially, the only services that they are providing will be the shopping and delivery of items. They are able to grow well with the use of technology. For example, internally they use an Android app that allows ‘bees’ to receive orders. Nevertheless, Jonathan mentioned that currently it is still exists as a manual process. This can definitely be automated to reduced much of the overhead costs. An order can immediately be routed to a free ‘bee’ together with the list of items etc. Doing so will help save time and manpower costs as well as allow them to garner good analytics into the demographics and patterns of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about how Honestbee works, Jonathan also provided some good insights into the business model. They utilise a revenue share model. Taking an example of an order of $100, they will be able to obtain a 20% commission. Out of this $20, their overall profit is only $10 as shown below.
$20-$5(shopper cost)-$5(delivery  cost) = $10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several teams in Honestbee which work together. These include: business, customer service, product (engineering, design, data), operations teams. He emphasised the crucial need for each of these teams to work hand in hand and communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan also shared the various challenges he faced. Factoring in the customer acquisition costs, each customer only turns profitable from the fifth order onwards. Also, he mentioned the poor visibility they have on stock availability. This is especially true due to their reliance on the supermarket to have the various products they are looking for.
Also, delivery costs are only minimised with economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by Henry Chan from Shopback. Shopback is based on the idea of customers getting cashbacks on their online purchases. Henry provided some great insights on e-commerce as a whole. He pointed out that e-commerce in Southeast Asia has a very low penetration rate which essentially means a huge growth opportunity for the next 5-6 years. One of the key markets to tap on will be Indonesia where online shopping and mobile penetration rates are growing rapidly. Henry also emphasised that entrepreneurs must be willing to learn and have the hunger to achieve and that expanding your business is all about having the right people around you. This pointed out the importance of networking, about having good contacts in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked how his business adapts to smaller markets where technology is generally less advanced, he said that such a situation is indeed a good opportunity where you can have greater expansion and tap deeper into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting questions was if both the founders give employees stock options. I felt that this is a great way to align employees’ interests together with the company’s goals. While stock options may not guarantee any value, this orientation towards a common goal is crucial in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, both of them provided an important tip for budding entrepreneurs:Don’t be shy in validating your idea. One of them even mentioned, that they requested people in Starbucks to test drive their prototype and gain feedback. I am sure validation is a crucial part every new product has to achieve and this must be done early in the prototyping stage itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learnt a lot from this session and definitely looking forward to the next session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish V&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NUS Second Year | First Semester in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The past semester is definitely the busiest semester I have been through. There was literally no time for anything else other than studies and projects. Part of the reason (as you will see), is that I took 8 modules this time. However, one of them, CP3108B - Orbital has already been completed. Two of the other modules CP2201 and CFG1001 lasted only for the first half of the semester, thankfully. This allowed for a slightly relaxed timetable in the second half of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I am really glad that I managed to do my best through the semester. And for those who are anticipating such a semester, I felt you might find a review of the modules handy. So here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP 2201: Journey of the Innovator &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a module about entrepreneurship and is worth 2 MCs. The grading is also in the form of Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or Completed Unsatisfactorily (CU) which means that the grade obtained will not affect the current CAP you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I found this module to be very engaging and entertaining. It provided me with what I wanted to learn about entrepreneurship. Each week, there were invited guest speakers who share their experience on entrepreneurship. A typical outline of the module looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 1: Introduction to module and some basic information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 2: Guest speakers from PropertyGuru and Reebonz with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 3: Guest speakers from upcoming startups: Klinify, Lomotif and InvestingNote with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Week 4: Guest speakers from Red Dot Ventures and Golden Gate Venture with Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, there will be a short assignment which requires some reflection on various aspects of entrepreneurship as well as the guest speakers and the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a great module to learn from entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Oh did I mention that there is a buffet dinner and networking session for 30 mins weekly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS2101: Effective Communication for Computing Professionals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a twinned module with CS2103T (see below). Basically, this module teaches you to write and present your ideas in an effective manner. Communication skills, writing skills and presentation skills are the 3 most crucial skills required to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this module good as I was able to pick up on the above-mentioned skills. However, there are a number of continual assessments for this module since there are no final exams. This means you will be kept busy almost every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some of the CAs are simple activities like doing a reflection on communication or your oral presentations. Some of the assessments I remember doing are:
- Reflection on Communication Skills &amp;amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Oral Presentation 1 (OP1)
- Writing a Project Proposal
- Writing of a Progress Report on the software project
- Oral Presentation 2 (OP2)
- Reflection 2 on OP2 &amp;amp; Commenting on others’ reflections
- Writing of a Project Manual (Developer and User Guide)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do well in this module, it is crucial to have the enthusiasm and appreciation for what you are doing. Of course, that will also help you to be more participative in your class (participation is also counted for grading). Also, I cannot emphasise enough on having a good team who can support you in these tasks. This is definitely not a one-man-army type of module for you to do alone. Effective teamwork is important in bringing out the best in most parts of the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CS2013T - Software Engineering &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been looking forward to this module for some time. Personally, I love software engineering and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module was personally very enriching and I got to learn a lot in terms of the various software engineering principles. That being said, this is one of the most hectic modules. As a team of 4, we were tasked to build a desktop-based task manager from scratch which had a primary input through the keyboard. By task manager, I mean a productivity software akin to popular ones like Google Keep, Todoist, Wunderlist, Any.do etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grading of the module was divided into 3 main areas: Project (50%), Final Exam (40%) and Participation (10%). As such, the project hold the majority of the weightage and that makes this module different from conventional ones. We apply what we learn. Every week, the lecture introduces new principles and concepts relevant to software engineering. Much of these knowledge can be immediately applied to the project we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS2103T is also twinned with CS2101 (as described above). Hence, many of the things we do such as developer’s guide, user guide etc. are relevant to the project. The use of version control (Git or GitHub) is extremely crucial for the project and came in really handy. We are prone to introduce bugs/errors when 3-4 people “operate” on the code simultaneously. Having revision control allowed such to keep track of these changes and simply revert our changes if we found them to be buggy later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation segment is the easiest to score and you should definitely score the full 10% here. Points can be earned through the proper completion of pre-tutorial and in-tutorial activities, answering questions in lectures, successful completion of weekly lectures quizzes on IVLE etc. There is maximum cap of 200 points which means that any points exceeding the 200th mark will not contribute to the participation points for grading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam tests the skills we have learnt throughout the semester. If you have learnt and applied these concepts well for the software project, it will be much easier to score here. The CS2103T module handbook (a 200-page document/textbook companion) is a must-read for scoring well for the exams. It helps to reinforce the concepts learnt and clears the small gaps in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I learnt a lot through this module. My team and I managed to create quite a cool desktop application called “FINI”. The name inspired from French, in which Fini refers to finished or accomplished. We felt that this accurately represents the goal of our app and it was easy to remember too! 
These are some of the screenshots of the application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/rwUcDNl.png&quot; alt=&quot;FINI&#39;s Welcome Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OIFjxyi.png&quot; alt=&quot;FINI&#39;s Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, my team and I became really passionate about what we were doing and we even made a cool video for our Oral Presentation 2 in CS2101 and to also serve as an introductory product demo video during our CS2103T demonstration. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/utI1N5hhFSs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINI is available for download and use here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cs2103aug2015-t16-1j/fini/releases/tag/v0.5&quot;&gt;GitHub Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an interesting yet hectic module. If you love creating cool stuff, you will love this module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆	☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2020 - Digital Fundamentals &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 5MCs module which is split into 2 parts. The first part is relatively easier to understand and introduces the basic building blocks of computers such as logic gates. The second part is focused mostly on slightly more intricate topics such as Finite State Machines (FSMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also lab and project components in this module. The labs are mostly manageable and primarily introduces the use of FPGAs and the hardware description language known as Verilog. The project is done individually and it involved creating an oscilloscope out of the FPGA. This was really cool because oscilloscopes generally cost many hundreds of dollars. Using a simple FPGA to create an oscilloscope was indeed interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it involved writing Verilog for the FPGA to interpret and display the incoming signal from the signal generators in the lab. The project was graded individually with a range of criteria. Two main influencing factors are the number of features (such as scaling, translating, displaying words/labels, pointers) and the uniqueness of the features &lt;em&gt;as compared to your peers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no final exams. Instead there is a midterm quiz and final quiz (each 20%) and the rest of the assessment is based on labs and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, a manageable module. Be creative with the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; EE2021 - Devices and Circuits &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module has a lot of theory and formulas on semiconductors. Personally, I found it quite intensive and usually took me the most time out of all my modules to revise and gain a complete understanding of what was being taught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment for this module is Homework (10%), Midterm test (20%), Quiz (5%), Final Exam (65%), though I do not remember taking a quiz for the 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics covered were very structured starting from the building blocks and slowly moving on to bigger components: Semiconductors -&amp;gt; PN junctions -&amp;gt; Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT) -&amp;gt; Metal Oxide Semiconductors Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) -&amp;gt; CMOS Logic -&amp;gt; Single Stage Amplifiers -&amp;gt; Multistage Amplifiers -&amp;gt; Opamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was really overwhelming and was like a bit of PC1432 again. The first part (before midterms) is usually much easier to understand than the second part. So make sure you ace the midterms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, a difficult module indeed due to the time commitment for understanding and revision. If you can appreciate what you learn, it will greatly help in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; LAF1201 - French 1 &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this module out of curiosity and the eagerness to learn a new language. I had shortlisted Chinese, Hindi and French and finally decided on French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Firstly, we need to understand that learning a language takes considerable time and effort to both learn, grasp and then practice speaking it. And doing all this while juggling other modules during a period of 1 semester is not a joke. French is apparently written with English alphabets with some accented ones. Also, it is similar to English or rather English is similar to French. As compared to other languages like Chinese and Hindi, this meant that I do not need to spend extra time learning to write the new alphabets which would help to save a considerable amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say French was really awesome. The people I met were mostly from FASS, but there were a few of them like me from Engineering or some from Pharmacy and Business. I really liked like environment. It was very interactive and my lecturer Dr Daniel Chan made sure everyone participated in each lesson. The interaction and fun during lessons made me like French even more. To ensure this interaction, all lessons are tutorials (no lectures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workload wise, since there are no final exams, you will be having tests / quizzes / homework more frequently than you would have expected to. There are quizzes on the French culture, vocabulary, grammar, audio recording of a self-introduction, writing of an email for an imaginative scenario etc. The final test is an oral conversation between 2 you and two others from your group in front of the lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say it is relatively easy to score for the tests if you have consistently practised French (both writing and speaking). That being said, also means that your peers will score well. Personal advice is to revise the notes posted on IVLE and use Google Translate to its fullest capability. I also utilised the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; app (web &amp;amp; mobile) to learn much of the content. Oh yes, if you have an iPhone, you can set the language for Siri as French and converse with it in French. It’s quite cool and you can also check on your pronunciation by seeing if Siri understands what you just said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very enjoyable module taught by a great lecturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CP3108B - Independent Work (Orbital Programme) &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Orbital programme during the summer break before my semester 1. I have written a post on the Orbital experience which is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/blog/education/nus/college/techstuff/2015/08/19/Orbital%202015/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/orbital-2015&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): ☆ ☆	☆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; CFG1001 - Headstart Module &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a 0 MCs module to prepare you for your career, there is a reason I have written about it here. Before attending the sessions, I was a little complacent and thought of this module as something that is snatching my precious time away. However, upon attending the module, I thought differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module helps to expose how it is like in the “real” world outside of NUS. Preparing for a career also includes preparing for the various interviews, networking with others etc. And it helped me understand and appreciate the importance of many skills and pointers which will definitely come in handy during my interview applications etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is graded with a Completed Satisfactorily (CS) or CU (Completed Unsatisfactorily) grade. You’ll just need to attend all the 2-3 face-to-face sessions to get a CS grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (out of 5): (Nil)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I just realised I have 4 consecutive exams in the coming semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess I need to mentally prepare for it. After all, the only easy semester was the last semester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Solving Einstein&#39;s Riddle</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IgXHPOF.jpg &quot; alt=&quot;Einstein&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting riddle written by Einstein in the last century. He claimed that &lt;strong&gt;98%&lt;/strong&gt; of the people in the world will not be able to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-riddle&quot;&gt;The Riddle:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 5 different houses, each of a different colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a owner of a different nationality in each house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the owner drinks a specific type of drink.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner smokes a specific type of cigarettes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each of the house owner has a specific type of pet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;None of the owners drink the same drink / smoke the same cigarette brand / have the same type of pets / have same nationality / live in the same house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-clues&quot;&gt;The Clues:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Brit lives in the red house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Swede keeps dogs as pets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Dane drinks tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house is on the left of the white house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the green house’s owner drinks coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man living in the center house drinks milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives in the first house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the German smokes Prince&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the Norwegian lives next to the blue house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are challenged to find out who has the fish using the above information and clues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that though the information seems sparse and disjointed, there is indeed a logical path for you to work out the riddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the houses layed out in a horizontal manner with the first house on your left to the last house on your right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obZ1VNWm8waHp2NUU/preview&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we list out all the possibilities for each category. The categories are nationality, colours, drinks, pets, house number and cigarette brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nationality
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Norwegian&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dane&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Swede&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Colours
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;White&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Yellow&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drinks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Beer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pets
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dogs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cats&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Birds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Horses&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fishes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House Number
1,2,3,4,5 respectively for each house from left to right&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cigarette Brand
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dunhill&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Blends&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;BlueMaster&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pall Mall&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prince&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we write whatever we know in a table form. As we gather more and more information from the clues, we fill the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Next, we know that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means that the 2nd house in the row is blue. The man in the center house drinks milk. And we are told that the green house is on the left of the white house and that the green house’s owner drinks coffee. The clue that the green house is on the left of the white house tells that the 4th and 5th houses have to be green and white respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brit lives in a red house. The first house has already been occupied by the Norwegian and we know the colours of the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses. This leads us to the fact that the center house is red and the Brit lives there. Also, this leaves the first house to be yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green house’s owner drinks coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting together all these information, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/UkHinqI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill, we know the Norwegian smokes Dunhill. Therefore, the 11th clue tells us that the man in the blue house keeps horses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th clue tells us that the man who smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer must be in the 2nd or 5th house (since the first house is occupied by the Norwegian and men in 3rd and 4th house drink milk and coffee respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider the first house. The options of drinks left for the Norwegian are water, beer and tea. Since the Dane drinks tea, that option is out. Since the Norwegian smokes Dunhill, beer is out. We are left with water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last clue makes it evident that the man in the 2nd house smokes blend. That means the man in the last (5th) house smokes BlueMaster and drinks beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the option of tea for the 2nd house and hence, it means the Dane lives in the 2nd house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current table looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Zi95yp8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blend&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dunhill&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13th clue now shows that the only option for the German who smokes Prince is in the 4th house. This leaves the last house for the Swede who has dogs as pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 6th clue shows that the Brit smokes PallMall and rears birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 10th clue shows that either the first or third house has cats. Since the third house has birds, this means that the Norwegian keeps cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished table will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;undefined;table-layout: fixed; width: 435px&quot;&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;col style=&quot;width: 120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Nationality&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Drink&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Smokes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Pets&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;House No.&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;German&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Coffee&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Prince&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fish&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dane&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blends&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Horses&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brit&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Milk&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;PallMall&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Birds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Swede&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Beer&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;BlueMaster&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dogs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;White&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Norwegian&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Water&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Dunhill&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cats&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only leaves us with the German who must have the fish. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gamecraft 2015!</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/KnFi8cM.png &quot; alt=&quot;TwistedMaze Logo&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently participated in Gamecraft 2015. This is my 2nd time participating this is “game-hackathon”. This time my team consisted of Al, Ted, Chris &amp;amp; myself. The theme for this year was “Twist”. As usual, the interpretation of this theme in relation to the game was left open to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that came to my mind was a maze that twists. As I was imagining this idea, I suddenly had this inspiration from this book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner&quot;&gt;The Mazerunner&lt;/a&gt;. It is a book where a group of “hostages” have to escape from a ever-changing labyrinth. There has also been a movie released with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggested this idea and we tried brainstorming a few ideas before settling and finalising on this one. After this decision, we focused our efforts towards the game development. Me and Chris took on the roles of the game design where we made the shifting maps for the maze and the necessary sprites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted was the sound engineer and gather suitable sounds for use in the game. Al, being the lead programmer of the group, devoted his attention to the game physics and the actual coding of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We utilised Unity for the game and eventually (after 24 hrs) managed to come up with a finished game, TwistedMaze. TwistedMaze is available for download (both Mac and Windows versions) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/TwistedMaze/releases&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future work on porting the game to Android and iOS is currently being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish V&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Getting Things Done (GTD) Framework</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We all talk about productivity and efficiency today. So here is my way of getting my things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I primarily use two platforms to get my stuff done: &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflowy.com&quot;&gt;Workflowy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendar.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. Workflowy is an amazing platform that is buuilt on a simple idea: making lists. At first look, it may look so simple and plain and even no greater than a Notepad like web-app. But, it is amazing intuitive to use and I am usually able to structure and plan according the the priority of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually think in a structured, top-down way and I would probably attribute that to my engineering-based education. So a typical structure I impose in Workflowy is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urgent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upcoming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;KIV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are listed in order of priority and shows me which task I need to get done next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under each of these categories, I make tasks and their relevant sub-tasks. For example, I have an Engineering exam this coming week, I create a task called “Engineering Exam”. Under this task, I include a label called “Details” which indicates the time, date and location of this task and “Revision” which then contains the relevant sections and chapters to revise as sub-sub-tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest things about Workflowy is that you can create many many layers of sub-sub-sub-sub-…. tasks. However, an important feature that is missing is reminders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I use Google Calendar. All deadlines and events immediately go into my Google Account with a default alert set for 1 and 2 days before the actual date. This together with my list of tasks of Workflowy keeps me organised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I check this list at the start of the day and update it as and when tasks come in. At the end of the day, I check if all intended tasks for the day have been completed. If yes, I complete them. If no, I move and reschedule them on the level of priority. Before sleeping, I spend 5 minutes working out the relevant tasks and agenda for tomorrow by simply adding a hashtag (#tomrrow) beside the tasks in Workflowy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system has worked great so far and I believe it has been a key reason for my productivity too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish V&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons from Entrepreneurs</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past semester, I undertook a module in NUS known as “Journey of the Innovator” (CP2201). More than just a module, it was conducted in an interesting and engaging seminar style. Each week, many lessons on entrepreneurship were shared and in one of the weeks, 3 startup founders were invited to share their views and insights into entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;klinify&quot;&gt;Klinify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk was by Krish, the CEO and Founder of Klinify. Personally, I found Klinify’s mission to “provide the freedom of paper with the power of digital technology” intriguing. It aims to propagate a change within the medical industry and empower doctors to harness the strengths of technology to further improve the medical services being delivered. During his talk, Krish mentioned some importants points on entrepreneurship that he has learnt thus far. I have combined those pointers, together with my learning points from the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on a specific sector: Klinify’s target audience are very specific. It is specifically targeted at the providers of medical service, doctors. While their ultimate goal is to extend the platform of Klinify globally, their current milestone is to establish themselves in Singapore and in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Klinify offers hybrid storage: This might be a little technical. Conventionally, a patients records (in paper) are only available physcially in the hospital. However, by digitalizing medical recors, now patient records are both available locally and on the cloud. By sharing it on the cloud, the medical records are now more accessible than ever. This could even offer a centralised patient records system to help doctors view and understand the patient’s medical history well before treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reasons for Klinify’s potential success: Klinify does not aim to change doctors’ natural way of doing things. Their workflow remains the same. Doctors are still able to write like they do on paper. They have customised templates. They can attach photos and even annotate. All these features help doctors to transition from their current pen-and-paper workflow to the digital platform with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some concerns on Klinify: Security. Technology rules today’s world. However, the growth of technology has brought about potential incentives for people to expose data. Medical records are meant to be private. In an event of a security breach, millions of medical records can be leaked. However, during the talk, Krish did mention their focus to ensure the safety and privacy of patient records. And only a strong defence system can deter such security compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lomotif&quot;&gt;Lomotif&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was by Paul from Lomotif. Lomotif is essentially a mobile application that allows users to create a video from their stash of videos and even add songs to it. After using it, a clear winning point of Lomotif was the usability factor. It was very simple to use and even a novice mobile user will be able to use it easily. 
Some pointers from Paul:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Market saturation: There will be a point in time when your target market becomes saturated. And Paul mentions that we should definitely anticipate this. To overcome this, we need to try and leverage on another market. I think this can be done in a couple of ways. Various markets are segmented by factors such as age, culture and perception. Hence, an expansion into another market requires a change in the app / technology that addresses one or more of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some interesting features of Lomotif: It’s collaborative, expressive and fun. This fun factor is one of the main reasons which helps Lomotif stand out from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 Crucial Factors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Good Team&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Customer Acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Making your customers happy.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;investing-note&quot;&gt;Investing Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third talk was by Shanison from InvestingNote. InvestingNote is a social network site targeted specifically at investors in Singapore and in the regional space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon using the InvestingNote platform, I like the user-friendly interface and the summarised view of stocks/shares and other information. Personally, I believe that such a social-platform can be of great use to investors. Facilitating communication among investors is something new I have seen and if brought about to the target market correctly, I believe this can be a good success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the above pointers are critical in ensuring the success of the start-up. While it may be true that most start-ups fail eventually, I think keeping the above pointers in mind will definitely aid them to beat the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
V.Harish&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MVC Design Pattern</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model-View-Controller (MVC) is one of the most popular design patterns in the software/web development world. The MVC model was popularised by the Spring Framework, Ruby on Rails and Django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, there are three main components of this pattern: Model, View and Controller. An application can be divided into these components which will then interact with one another to achieve the intended objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interaction-overview&quot;&gt;Interaction Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/U7Z1Eir.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;model&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model component can be summarised to contain objects that provide the logic implementation for the application. Typically, these objects correspond with the storage to retrieve/update/store data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated on &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd381412(v=vs.108).aspx&quot;&gt;the MSN MVC Overview&lt;/a&gt;, for small applications, the model does not necessarily refer to a physical layers and its subclasses. If an application just reads a dataset and passes it to the view, then the dataset there takes the role of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;view&quot;&gt;View&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View essentially contains the objects/components dealing with the user interface (UI) of the application. The view typically reflects and outputs the data from the model layer. If the model consists of a dataset of students, then the view probably contains a table view of the details of the students with fields such as the First Name, Last Name, Age, Matriculation Number and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;controller&quot;&gt;Controller&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controller are components which handle the user interaction and communicate directly with the model, depending on what the user’s request is. Based on this communication and response, it then selects a view to render. For example, if the user searches for a specific student’s name, the controller then passes the query to the model which then looks up the database, applies necessary filters and then returns the data representing the student (assuming it is a valid search). The controller will now select the appropriate view to present the data to the user. For example, views may change based on the platform (PC/mobile phone/tablet) or the type of user accounts (root/admin/guest) etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;implementation--advantages&quot;&gt;Implementation &amp;amp; Advantages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways the MVC can be implemented. For example, one can choose to divide the interactions both on the client and server side for a web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MVC model can come in particularly handy to organise the structure of an application during development. It can help in parallel development as different members of the team can work on the various components together. Another advantage is that we can separate the concerns of the application in a distinct manner which allows for better developer focus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tutorial - Introduction to HTML (Part 2)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/tech/general/techstuff/2015/09/20/Introduction%20to%20HTML%20P1.html&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, we covered the basics of HTML, the structure, declaring headings, paragraphs and adding images in a HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we look at hyperlinks, making lists (ordered/unordered/nested), making comments, adding styles (fonts, colors, background color, bold, italics) &amp;amp; tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hyperlinks&quot;&gt;Hyperlinks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinks are links such as &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. These are the words or images you click to go to a new page! To link a word to point to another page/image etc., we can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example will look like this:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
	&amp;lt;a href=&quot;www.google.com&quot;&amp;gt;Google&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translates into: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you click on “Google”, it brings you right to Google’s homepage. You can observe this by simply hovering your mouse on “Google”. Your browser shows where the link points to at the bottom of the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinks come in handy when you need to redirect your users/viewers to another webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists have mainly 2 forms: ordered and unordered. We can create an ordered (numbered) list of things in HTML by using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.
Similarly, we can create unordered(bullet) lists in HTML by using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Ordered List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; List point no. 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; List point no. 2 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translates into: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; List point no. 1 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; List point no. 2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Unordered List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; List point no. 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; List point no. 2 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translates into: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; List point no. 1 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; List point no. 2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also create nested lists. Simply, include your list inside the parent &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Nested Lists&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vegetables&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fruits
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Apples&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Oranges&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pears&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Snacks&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will translate into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fruits
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Oranges&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Pears&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Snacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, “Apples”, “Oranges” and “Pears” are nested list items under Fruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;font-size-colors-families--emphasis&quot;&gt;Font Size, Colors, Families &amp;amp; Emphasis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is boring to look at a website entirely presented in a same font like Times New Roman or Arial. Also, we can specify a certain font size for the words. We can change this font by using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; property. This property must be included within the tag (i.e. before closing the tag).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Font Size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;font-size: 30px&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 30px&quot;&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now realise our entire output is in plain black and white. That’s so boring. Let’s add some colors now, with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; property. This is really simple and similar to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Font Color&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;color: blue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blue Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;color: green&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this gives us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt; Blue Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: green&quot;&gt; Green Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the font size and colors, to change the font-type, we use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt; property. This is utilized in the same way as font-size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Font-Family&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;font-family: Garamond&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;font-family: Verdana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Garamond&quot;&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Verdana&quot;&gt; Your Paragraph here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to highlight certain important information. Commonly, we use the bold and emphasis of words to highlight something important. To achieve this in HTML we use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags for bold and italics respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Text Emphasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello There!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello There!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this gives us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello There!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello There!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combine multiple properties, we simply use: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p style=&quot;font-size:20px; font-family:Garamond;&quot;&amp;gt;Sample Paragraphy&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which produces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:20px; font-family:Garamond;&quot;&gt;Sample Paragraphy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply, separate the various properties with the use of the semi-colon: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other properties that can be included such as color, font-weight etc. which will be covered under CSS which stands for Cascadin Style Sheets. CSS can simplify and is the professional method to style web elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tables&quot;&gt;Tables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can add tables to our HTML code by using tables. To achieve this, we utilize &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That may be a lot of tags, but it helps to structure our table nicely. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; refers to the table row, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; refers to the table column and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; refers to the row heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example: Tables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;	
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jack&#39;s Details&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mary&#39;s Details&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Jack&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mary&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anderson&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Smith&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;21&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;24&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Jack&#39;s Details&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Mary&#39;s Details&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Jack&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Mary&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
	  &lt;td&gt;Anderson&lt;/td&gt;
	  &lt;td&gt;Smith&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at what is being written, we can see that we define the table is a very structured way, row by row. The top row is the heading and uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Subsequent rows (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to indicate the details such as First Name, Last Name and Ages. The entire table is enclosed with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags which mark the start and end of the table respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above information, we can create a simple website! Here’s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;My Webpage&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Hobbies&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My hobbies are swimming, badminton and writing code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Current Projects&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am currently developing the technological breakthrough in computer sciences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Additional Information&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am currenly involved in blah...blah...blah...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;My Favorite Picture&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://lh5.ggpht.com/cb7PU-mvWE1_JxMlpQwyNfMk7yL9kUByZj3bS2YLcPkLor8V6RfkwMzt76_BsZaz0rad=h900&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Some Emphasis on Text! &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Hello There!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Hello There!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Hyperlinks... A lot of them! &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.google.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Google&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.yahoo.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yahoo!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.apple.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Apple&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.samsung.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Samsung&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.bing.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Bing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.download.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Download.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;www.harishv7.github.io/tech&amp;quot;&amp;gt;My website!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; My List! &amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Vegetables&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Fruits
		    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
		      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Apples&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Oranges&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
			  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Pears&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Snacks&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h3 style=&amp;quot;font-family: Garamond&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Just playing with some styles&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;color: blue&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Blue Text!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;color: green&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Green Text!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;color: yellow&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Yellow Text!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p style=&amp;quot;color: violet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Violet Text!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; A Sample Table &amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Jack&amp;#39;s Details&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;th&amp;gt;Mary&amp;#39;s Details&amp;lt;/th&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
		    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Jack&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Mary&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
			  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Anderson&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
			  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Smith&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; 
		  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;21&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
		    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;24&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
		  &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;
		
		
	&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/harishv7/414c2db23055af890658.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output will look like this:

        <title>Tutorial - Introduction to HTML (Part 1)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first part of the Introduction to HTML, I will be going through the basics of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. This is the standard markup language which allows web browsers (such as Internet Explorer/Firefox/Chrome) to render content into the webpages you visit (yes, including this one). If you haven’t been acquainted with HTML at all, you might want to try right-click and “view page source” on Chrome/Firefox browsers. A typical screenshot of the page source (from Apple.com) is this:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Hsg4sWu.png&quot; alt=&quot;HTML page source of Apple.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t be daunted by the intimidating lines of code. We will start right from the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;structure-of-a-html-file&quot;&gt;Structure of a HTML File&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; Heading 1 &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		
		&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;	
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Start of a paragraph &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
		
	&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/harishv7/6896f30b6453a9cc5ae7.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is the basic structure of a HTML file. The document starts with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag which defines the start of the document. The file is basically divided into 3 major sections, namely, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head contains basic information such as the title of the webpage and some scripts or resources to be loaded when the file is opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body contains the main content of what the user is to see and the optional footer typically contains links to the various sections of the website etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in the head tag, we can include the site’s title. For example:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; 
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt; My Title &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above snippet will specify that the title of the webpage is “My Title”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can also try this out by copying the above snippet(s), pasting it into an editor of your choice (eg: Notepad/TextEdit/TextMate). If you are clueless which editor to use, I would suggest using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;headings&quot;&gt;Headings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can highlight certain parts of the page by selecting different sizes of headers. This is done with the header tag. Headings range from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where h1 defines the largest heading and h6 is the smallest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; This is a big heading &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; This is a big heading &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h6&amp;gt; This is a small heading &amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt; This is a small heading &lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;paragraphs&quot;&gt;Paragraphs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can include paragraphs with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; hello, i am harish. this is a sample paragraph. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; hello, i am harish. this is a sample paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No webpage is complete with just some simple text. So how do we add images?
You do it with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full tag looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Hello_logo_sm.gif&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Hello_logo_sm.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go. You have just added an image to your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding from local folders (pictures residing on your computer, offline) is slightly trickier. For example, if the picture is in the same folder as where you save your html file, and is called “picture.jpg”, then your image tag will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;picture.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If it is in a subfolder of your current html file, then it would look something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;subfolder/picture.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for the first part. A sample webpage that you should have by now should be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;My Webpage&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Hobbies&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My hobbies are swimming, badminton and writing code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Current Projects&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am currently developing the technological breakthrough in computer sciences.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Additional Information&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am currenly involved in blah...blah...blah...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;My Favorite Picture&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://lh5.ggpht.com/cb7PU-mvWE1_JxMlpQwyNfMk7yL9kUByZj3bS2YLcPkLor8V6RfkwMzt76_BsZaz0rad=h900&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/harishv7/051a48b69f31e427ece7.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scalability for Web Applications</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Attended Friday Hacks, which are hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://nushackers.org/&quot;&gt;NUSHackers&lt;/a&gt;, where each week a guest speaker is invited to give talks on the latest tech developments etc. Today’s talk was on scalability by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryandao.net/&quot;&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; from PayPal, who provided some good insights [1]. Personally, I am keen on web development and am currently working on some web applications as side-projects apart from university projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the presentation focused on measuring your web application’s performance. Some great tools that were introduced include ApacheBench and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webpagetest.org/&quot;&gt;webpagetest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of latency was also stressed during the introduction. To understand latency, let’s consider the scenario when someone from Singapore is accessing a web application hosted from the US. Here, we are concerned how fast can a packet be sent over? These packets typically are routed through several servers and poor cable networks before reaching you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point on the things not to do was having too many JavaScript files. Simply don’t have too many of these:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;myjsfile.js&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a web development enthusiast myself, I could agree to this. Having multiple file references also means that more number of requests are being made to refresh/load these files. This can be simply minimised by unifying the separate files into one large file during deployment. Of course, minify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part introduced Amdahl’s Law, which states:
&amp;gt; the speedup of a parallel algorithm is limited by the fraction of the problem that must be performed sequentially; that is, your design is only as strong as its weakest link. [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a building evacution was given. For example, all the people in a building are evacuating a building through a single door. Ultimately, the entire evacuation process will be slowed down. However, compare it with having 2 doors (x2 faster) or an infinte number of doors (takes no time at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then brings the topic of instances of web applications. For example, having a single instance means that a single request received by the server is processed fully first, and then it moves onto the second difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In web development, it is crucial to consider both concurrency and parallelism. These are two of the most confused as being the same. Though not the same, they are related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, concurrency is about &lt;em&gt;dealing&lt;/em&gt; with many things at once (deals with the structure), while parallelism is about &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; a lot of things at once (deals with the execution). Hence, concurrency is basically a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently [3]. The Go language, for example, is built with concurrency in mind [4].
Then we have asynchronous IO (AKA non-blocking IO) is a form of input-output processing that allows us to continue with other processing/actions before the current task has completed fully. Node.JS is an example of a JavaScript runtime environment that employs this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part focuses on infrastructure. Today, the best ways for scaling without having to buy expensive bare metal servers, would be cloud hosting and deployment. For example, Netflix is hosted on Amazon Cloud, whereas GitHub employs hosting from bare metal physical servers. Cloud advancements have provided great scope for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example is autoscaling (pre-requisite is having stateless apps). Autoscaling allows us to monitor resource exhaustion/redudance and spawn or kill as many instances as required by the situation. While this is cost-effective and resilient, it is also harder to test/debug/implement etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above information and factors come in crucial when attempting to scale as your demand grows. I feel the advancement of cloud technologies and deployment is great and has provided us with an easy way to scale and monitor our apps. As compared to the past, where people had to purchase/set up/maintain huge bulky physical servers, this is so much more hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entrepreneurship - Yay or Nay?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was an exciting day. Having taken the CP2201 module, Journey of the Innovator, today was the first 2 talks by self-made entrepreneurs and businessmen, Steve Melhuish from PropertyGuru and Samuel Lim from Reebonz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire session focused on how they built their business from scratch and the hurdles they went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;several-important-points-were-highlighted-throughout-the-session-such-as&quot;&gt;Several important points were highlighted throughout the session, such as:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For an entrepreneur, his focus should be on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a solid business model is crucial. The growth in online traffic (for web/mobile based businesses) helps to convert losses to profits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think big, and expand big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professionalise your business and scale appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invest in a good team with good leaders (CFO, CTO, CEO etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the best content and most traffic you can make it to be #1 in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;firstly-to-summarise-my-learning-from-propertyguru&quot;&gt;Firstly, to summarise my learning from PropertyGuru:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of PropertyGuru was to allow transparency of information in the property market by placing the entire market online to solve a real-world issue: Everyone needs a home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several growth tactics were used to leverage on the growing population in emerging countries, rising smartphone and broadband penetration rates and increasing trend of online marketplaces and online transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is crucial to ensure that there is ongoing PR to keep the publicity going with the media, so that people are aware of you and your business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick the ideal investor who is not only interested in the money made by the business, but rather willing to support the business with growth and opportunities. A strategic investor should bring intelligent information to provide insight on the current situation of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Size and Valuation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pitch Documents: Keep some documents ready at hand, both a 2-page document and a 20-page version, to pitch to others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive tension: If many investors are interested, we can potentially increase the valuation of the business. Get as many parties interested as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good M&amp;amp;A lawyer: It is important to have a good Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) lawyer to prevent ‘unwanted’ takeovers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business today will face challenges on different levels, such as:
- Scaling (Revenue &amp;amp; Costs involved)
- Increasing levels of competition: No longer limited to the local scale, but rather we are competing on a regional or even global scale.
- Staying nimble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes I found during the presentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good companies meet needs, Great companies create markets”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“As an entrepreneur always be paranoid of competitors and them taking away your market!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-part-of-the-presentation-was-focused-on-reebonz&quot;&gt;The second part of the presentation was focused on Reebonz:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important points for aspiring entrepreneurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Little cash/capital is no longer a worry today. Innovation is largely valued and ideas can be executed with web/mobile apps which have minimal costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on market adoption. Even if your ideas are novel and you have your product ready, the market must be ready to adopt it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a business to survive in the long run, we need to adapt to the market landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on cutting loss. Ideas may need to change, don’t fall in love with your idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Growth is dependent on cash/capital. Find and learn to manage venture capital.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay true to your core beliefs and idea. Build the business model around this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt niche areas, where you can differentiate from other businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value and invest in customer relationships. This will help in gaining faster adoption and long-term customers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximise existing resources to create value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great quotes from the second-half of the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You don’t need the best team, but the right team”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“The hardest about evolving a business model is keeping true to your core brand idea”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Instead of finding places where there is already competition, find niche areas where you can dominate the business”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“See opportunities in problems”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Get a MVP, or beta model and launch it. Only then you will receive feedback on what the market wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Only the paranoid survives” – Quoted from Andrew Grove, Co-Founder of Intel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very fruitful session that stirred up the entrepreneur within me. The world needs change, and only innovation can drive that change. And entrepreneurs can lead that innovation. In that regard, I am motivated to become an entrepreneur myself to help make positive difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Orbital 2015</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/5EjaKFa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Friendezvous&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 months of hard work, the Orbital programme came to a close on 19th Aug 2015. It was a great experience and I picked up many skills of both front and back end development. I did the project with Al who was very supportive during the 3 months though he was on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s inspiration came from our shared experiences in daily college life. Many of the times we tend to organise meetings manually. A typical process goes like this (A,B,C are persons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A–&amp;gt;B: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? &lt;br /&gt;
B–&amp;gt;A: Yup, that’ll be good I guess. &lt;br /&gt;
A–&amp;gt;C: Hey, are you free tomorrow for a project meeting at 2-4pm? &lt;br /&gt;
C–&amp;gt;A: Oh no, I don’t think I’ll be free. How about some other day? &lt;br /&gt;
A (thinks to him/herself): Darn, got to ask B and C for another timing again! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the typical manual process is tedious where we often WhatsApp or message one another for free slots and try to match it all up for a common time to meet. In the point of view of the meeting administrator, it is a rather painstaking process when he/she has to repeatedly ask the team members for a suitable time to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this issue, I suggested to Al that we should maybe develop a platform which can make the organising of meetings simpler and redefine the ways of doing so. And from there, Friendezvous was born. Friendezvous is an amalgamation of the words Friend and Rendezvous (a meeting at an agreed time and place). So essentially Friendezvous refers to meetings with friends, colleagues etc. And we decided on a relevant tagline as well: “Organising meetings, redefined.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I should describe a little of the technical aspects of Friendezvous as well. Friendezvous was built using the good old LAMP stack. We used PHP and MySQL along with front-end technologies/frameworks such as HTML, CSS, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap (modified), Angular JS. The development itself was not the difficult part. The hardest part of this journey was to think as an user of this platform. How would an user using Friendezvous feel about the workflow of this app? Is it too complicated? Can we improve on the workflow to minimise the number of steps/clicks an user is required to make to achieve an objective? These are the various questions which were running on our minds all the time. After all, software/app development is not just about blinding writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with real life users here. Then, we decided to conduct a survey to analyse the perception of our target audience towards the platform. We did it with a closed circle of friends and received very positive feedback. It was definitely a morale booster to our idea and efforts. More than anything, we were passionate about what we did. Even if we made a positive difference in a single person’s life, it would mean a lot to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbital Splashdown, where all the teams (from beginner, intermediate &amp;amp; advanced levels) came together to showcase their work, was held on 19th August 2015. It was exhilarating to see so many applications built by students like myself. I was inspired by many apps, with their technical aspects as well as the business models they were planning to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was extremely joyful when the visitors to my booth exclaimed “Wow, that is one app I think I would use!” or “This is an excellent app bro!”. They were also impressed at the various features like notification tracking and location suggestions Friendezvous offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, Orbital 2015 was an exciting journey. I am going to make it a point to develop an application every summer. I find fulfilment in learning so many technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Friendezvous, currently it is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://friendezvous.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;Friendezvous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development is very active and Al and myself aim to launch Friendezvous as a commercial platform soon (in about 3-5 months). After which, we are planning on porting this towards an Android and iOS application as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do try Friendezvous if you can and send me your comments in the comment box on my blog or to my &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#055;&amp;#064;&amp;#108;&amp;#105;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the Orbital programme is &lt;a href=&quot;http://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>NUS First Year | Semester 4 | (Special Term 2) in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CyberSecurity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Computer Security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being quite free during the summer vacation period, I decided to take up CS2107: Introduction to Information and System Security in Special Term 2. It was one of the most interesting modules I have taken taught by an ever youthful professor Hugh. His energy and enthusiasm and deep knowledge on computer security made me even more curious in the various aspects of computer security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module covers a wide range of topics from cryptography/ciphers, to common hacking methods (SQLi, Buffer overflows), protection mechanisms against such malcious attacks etc. The assessment was split into the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Homework &amp;amp; Assignments&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Project Work&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Final Exam&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 3 assignments (about 5-10 questions) which were to be done at home. They were largely manageable. Google is your best friend. Computer security is a broad topic and the more you learn, the better you understand and appreciate the various concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project work was indeed an interesting experience. My team consisted of Sri (not his real name), QY and myself. It was a tight timeline considering that the project was to be completed over a span of just 6 weeks. We embarked on the project about 2 weeks before submission, but we made the structure of the report very clear. Regular consultation with Prof Hugh was crucial in helping us achieve a clear understanding of the expectations of this project. As a team, we are really thankful for his advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our project was on “Common attacks on PC/UNIX/Mac devices”. Here focused on DDoS, Buffer Overflow exploitation and side-channel attacks. I personally involved myself largely towards the buffer overflow section in which I did code sample runs to check the implementation of a feature known as Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) on Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.10 and Ubuntu 15.04. We also compared the effectiveness the various operating systems against the aforementioned attacks and concluded Windows offered the best protection (of course, in reality there will be a wide range of external factors to be considered as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam was manageable. I was able to refer to the relevant sections of the notes since it was an open-book examination. Some questions are specifically targeted at your understanding and some were on concepts mentioned in lectures. I guess it paid off to attend each and every lecture and tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really glad I took this module. It is one of the best modules I have taken in NUS thus far and am currently contemplating taking CS3235 (Introduction to Computer Security) sometime later. Then again, the number of required breadth electives for CEG students has been reduced to just 1 which means I need to plan my modules well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also taking it in Special Term was great since it allowed me to concentrate fully on one subject. In the regular semester, with 5-6 modules, juggling time between these modules itself is a huge task for most students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: &lt;strong&gt;Manageable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Grade obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Remarks: Pretty interesting module taught by an amazing professor. Take it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Virtual Reality - Google Cardboard</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a Google Cardboard yesterday. The Google Cardboard comes as a laser-cut template (which you have fold and fix yourself), two 45mm biconvex lenses, 2 neodymium magnets, 2 pairs of velcro and a rubberband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really simple to fold and use and all you’ve to do is to download a VR app onto the phone and slot it into the font of the Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing about the Google Cardboard is that it utilises the magnetic switch as a trigger. So while using an app, using the ‘button’ will allow you to interact the same way as you touch your phone’s screen. As compared to other VR devices, such as the VR One, the magnetic switch is something exclusive to the Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many apps such as the Cardboard app (which allows you to watch movies, use Google Earth etc.), VR Roller Coaster (which takes you on a ride through the roller coaster) and the apps are definitely growing in number in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality is definitely here to stay and it’s development excites me. It opens up many new and different possibilities that people have only dreamt of. We can start to enjoy experiences which previously required us to be physically present elsewhere. The nascent virtual reality is rapidly developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether virtual reality is good or bad, that depends. There will always be people who might use VR technologies to enjoy in the world they want, without any grasp of reality. But on the other hand, VR’s potential can surely bring quality and happiness to many lives. For now, let’s hope that VR will bring us a more enjoyable future in the coming years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#images&quot;&gt;Below&lt;/a&gt; are pictures of the Google Cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Clean and Green Hackathon 2015</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cgs.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/For-Event-Subpages.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image Credits: http://www.cgs.sg/events/calendar/hackathon/workshop/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Clean &amp;amp; Green Hackathon this weekend. This is second hackathon I participated in after Gamecraft (Organised by NUS Games Development Group) last year. It was particularly a very enriching experience. Held on a larger scale (nation-wide) and open to all ideas and hacks (including hardware, software, apps, games etc.) and people from all age groups, I was able to understand what to expect in a hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a continuous 24 hours hackathon, we were allowed to go home and return the next morning. It took place over a period of 3 days, starting from Friday (Ideation and pitching) till Sunday (when the judging and prize presentation was held).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to know many people from different backgrounds and learn a lot from their ideas as well. Some were just there for the pure fun of it, to exchange ideas and make good friends. Some ideas were just excellent and gave me many new insights into further development of my own idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, my team (Kenny, Yong Zhi &amp;amp; myself) came up with the idea of a web &amp;amp; mobile ready platform called “The Greenlist”. It is basically a peer-to-peer connecting app where one can post his/her old items (eg: laptops, handphones, toys, books, furniture etc.) up for donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who needs this item but are willing to have it secondhand (and for free) can simply claim this item, and thereafter proceed to collect the item from the donor themselves. Each successful donation earns the donor some reward points which can then be redeemed for vouchers. To fund the operating costs (which are minimal), we proposed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-App Advertising&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In-App Purchases (Eco-friendly items etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sponsorship for vouchers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Optional donation before claiming an item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the idea was formed, we made a prototype both for the web and mobile platform (using Justinmind software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, as the group leader, I made the pitch for our idea and gave a demo of our prototype. Given only 3 minutes for the pitch, it was crucial to make the most out of each and every second to create an everlasting impression of the idea &amp;amp; product/service. Though nervous, having take some public speaking training and course in NUS allowed me to focus on the pitch and do my best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the learning points was that I realised that I might have focused too much on the demo of the prototype itself. I should have instead allocated a major part towards helping the audience understand and appreciate the relevance and usefulness of the app in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the idea is crucial in a hackathon (even more than the prototype)! An effective idea will definitely win people over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, my team did not win, we were thankful for the experience. This hackathon gave me some crucial experience that will help me do better in the forthcoming hackathons I will be participating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Greenlist” project is hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7/thegreenlist&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clean &amp;amp; Green Hackathon event was covered by Channel NewsAsia and the coverage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ideas-to-solve-littering/1931422.html?cid=fbsg&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NUS First Year | Second Semester in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a long freshman year and I am surprised I am already writing a review for my 2nd semester at NUS. Semester 2 was much tougher than Semester 1, but ironically my grades were slightly better (yes, I can’t believe it too!).Thanks to the bell curve I suppose. Anyway, here is the module review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CG1108: Electrical Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good module that introduces the basic concepts of electrical engineering. I found the pace of the lectures very manageable compared to other modules. The total number of chapters covered is actually not a lot, and hence it allows you enough time to fully comprehend and grasp the basic concepts before moving onto the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lecturer for this module was Dr Sahoo. He is a very approachable lecturer and teaches very well. I find it important to attend his lectures (never missed any) since most of the working and examples are done in the lecture itself. Though the slides with the digitally written solutions are uploaded, it is much easier to follow through the lecture and examples in real time rather than at home where you have to figure them out all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment of the module is shared equally between the hands-on segment and the theory section. Hands-on segment includes the labs (10% attendance and 10% lab test) and the exciting Arduino car project (25%). Labs are manageable and you will be guided by your group’s assigned mentor. The lab test is very similar to whatever content you have learnt during the practical labs and make sure to watch the equipment briefing video uploaded by the ECE department to have a complete knowledge of the equipment and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car project was what many of us were looking forward to. There was a lot of time given for us to work on the car project. It is of high importance that you select your groupmates carefully. They must appreciate your suggestions and be willing to help each other out and put in a good amount of effort to work together and achieve the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did not like about the car project was the lack of constant results. The car basically takes input from the light-dependent resistors (LDR) and these resistors are very sensitive to the ambient light which makes it difficult to get consistent results. Nevertheless, I think the car project was one of the most exciting parts of the module. I still remember my friends’ and my reaction when our car worked for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory section includes the mid-term test (10%) and final exam (40%). Both exams were manageable and as long as the basic concepts and application has been mastered it should not be a problem to score well. For the final exam, practising past year papers is crucial in understanding the type of questions to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GEK1549: Critical Thinking and Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GEK1549 was quite enjoyable. Like many, I did not like this module initially, but as time went, I began appreciating what was being taught. It is very systematic and really probes your thinking. The theme for our batch was on “Sustainable Cities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no lectures, only tutorials. My tutor was Dr Sadorra. She is really nice and approachable and gave me and my teammates very constructive comments and suggestions during the course of the module. She also prepares her own slides and provides good external references to clarify concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is divided into 3 parts. Assignment 1 (30%) requires the submission of a graphic organiser, summary and evaluation of a given article. Assignment 2 (30%) is a position paper that is done in groups. And Assignment 3 (10%) is essentially class participation. The other 30% comes from the final exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to do particularly well in both Assignments 1 &amp;amp; 2 and made effort to participate in class as much as possible. I felt the final exam was doable, but I was restricted due to the lack of time. Make sure you have good teammates for Assignment 2. Always have a clear foundation and roadmap as to what you will be doing for the position paper. In my case, for the problem-solution paper, I made sure that the problem and solutions are clearly linked. And to make our paper stand out, my teammates and I ensured that the proposed solutions were specific to the city and are feasible in the implmentation. Not an easy task, but you’ll get there after some considerable time into research and analysis. Be sure to utilise NUS Libraries website. The resources there will surely aid in obtaining reliable sources for the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a very manageable module, provided you put in good effort in understanding the tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1020: Data Structures and Algorithms I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my favourite module of this semester due to my personal interest in computer programming. But, this was definitely not a easy module. The content covered were heavy and it requires a lot of practise and understanding to get used to the concepts taught. And before you are familar with one concept another concept will be taught. It requires discipline and effort to do some programming and to study for the module daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecturers for this module are Mr Aaron Tan and Dr Low. Both lecturers are very good in terms of teaching new concepts. They give plenty of examples to ensure our understanding is complete. It is important to attend and understand tutorials. Even when I couldn’t do or finish a particular tutorial, I made it a point to attend classes to ensure I do not neglect the tutorial. It kept me on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment for the module was divided into many parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tutorial Attendance/Participation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lab Attendance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Take-Home Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sit-in Labs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mid-term Test&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Final Exam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The least you can do is to secure the marks from tutorial/lab attendance and take-home labs. This is greatly help in achieving a good grade. Take-home labs are often challenging, but you will given at least a week before the submission. Hence, ensure that you are able to solve these labs. Else, seek help during the lab sessions. The tutors are really helpful when you ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fast paced module. On any given week, you will most probably either have a sit-in lab or a take-home lab due. Consistent work and practice is of vital importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final exam was slightly tough for me. I realised I have made many careless mistakes after completing the exam. Otherwise, the difficulty of the questions asked were similar to those in tutorials. Focus on important topics such as recursion, hashing, sorting etc. These are major concepts that have a higher probability of being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a tough and fast paced module that definitely requires more effort than what you normally put in for a 4MC module. Discipline to revise and practice questions (on Codecrunch) on a regular basis is important from the start of the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my codes are hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/portfolio/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harishv7&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheatsheet for final exam is now hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwSVKyZQM1obbzVJUTBXWFIzVkk/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Please do write your own, this is only for reference, not reproduction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Tough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PC1432: Physics IIE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the toughest module for me. The rate at which chapters and concepts were covered was astonishing. I could barely keep up with the pace and was lost even before the recess week. It did not help that many of the chapters were inter-linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 3 lecturers. All of them were engaging and taught really well. But, it required a lot of effort from my side to fully grasp what they were saying and taking time to practice extra questions outside the tutorials. The questions from the tutorials are NOT enough as practice. The recommended textbook was really helpful for me to get a better understanding of the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment was divided into practical viva/reports (10%), online assignment from Mastering Physics (10%), mid-term test (20%) and final exam (60%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you do your best for the practicals and online assignments as these are relatively easier to score. The mid-term was manageable except for the time restriction. Planning your time during the examination is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the final exam very hard and was afraid I did not do as well as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a fast-paced and tough module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Very Hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MA1506: Mathematics II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MA1506 was much more manageable than MA1505, which I took in semester 1. This module covers a great depth into Differential Equations and linear algebra, linear transformations and Laplace transforms. Many of these concepts are crucial for engineering students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment is divided into mid-term test (20%) and final exam (80%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part involving differential equations (DE) was fairly manageable and was even fun when modelling systems. All it requires is a good understanding of the various ways to solve DEs which can be achieved with sufficient practice from tutorials. The mid-term test was fully MCQ (10 questions in one hour) and was quite easy. I was able to score full marks for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After recess week, the pace of lectures started to increase together with the difficulty of concepts. Webcasted lectures were really helpful when I was revising to clarify my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final exam was manageable. Make sure you have sufficient practice form the past year papers (check NUS Library website or IVLE). Since there are solutions provided, it helps to understand the structure of the questions. Questions are usually similar year to year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the help sheet (2 sides of 1 A4 sheet) is well prepared. You can see my help sheets &lt;a title=&quot;MA1505 &amp;amp; MA1506 Help Sheets&quot; href=&quot;https://harishv7.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/ma1505-ma1506-help-sheets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here for reference&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&quot;MA1505/MA1506 Helpsheets&quot; href=&quot;http://harishv7.github.io/nus/2015/05/26/MA1505%20&amp;amp;%20MA1506%20Help%20Sheets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, a manageable module, provided sufficient effort is put in to understand fundamental concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade Obtained: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Difficulty: Manageable&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MA1505 &amp; MA1506 Help Sheets</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Both MA1505 and MA1506 are common modules undertaken by a vast majority of engineering students. They are not exactly easy, and so I thought I will post the helpsheets I have made for my examinations here in the hope that some of the students may find it useful when doing their own helpsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do note that it is crucial for students to make their own helpsheets as printed or photocopied helpsheets are strictly not allowed. And from experience, it always helps to make your own helpsheet as it comes in as a form of revision.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NOC Interview (Round 1)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I went for the NOC interview a few weeks back, just before my final examinations for semester 2. As it was mentioned in the confirmatione email, it was agroup interview indeed. My session was on the morning of Thursday and had about 8 people including me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were divided into 2 groups and given a hypothetical situation to discuss upon. In my case, we were given 2 simple business models (not as complex as you think) and then we had to discuss which business model will be more successful in the long run. The interviewers were very friendly and approachable. It is crucial to note that the interviewers are NOT looking for a correct answer. In fact, there is no right or wrong answer and it depends entirely upon how you feel. As long as you and your groupmates agree upon a common model and explain in as much detail as possible why it is the better one, you would have done your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such group interview situations, the best way to make an impression is to try and lead the discussion from the start, which I did. So, instead of sitting around and looking at each other in awkward silence, initate the discussion and the overview. It was a good thing that all members of my team agreed uniformly on the model I had in mind. Then, immediately after settling the main topic of discussion, I tried to model the scope of the discussion by listing out the relevant factors to the topic. After which, I decided on the factors I will be presenting and the subsequent allocation of the other factors for my group members to present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the presentation went very well and at the end of the discussion it seemed that the interviewers did agree with our choice of model. I was happy to receive the news that I have successfully passed the first stage of the selection and am current anticipating the second round of interview coming soon in August/September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Points I learnt: &lt;/strong&gt;
You are being noted once you step into the interview room. Everything that you say and do will have an impact on the impression the interviewers have on you.
Learn to be concise. It’s not necessary to talk as much as possible to show that you are good. Being concise will show that you have a clear mind and are focused on what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;
Harish&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thoughts with Mass</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-140&quot; src=&quot;https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/uni6.gif?w=250&quot; alt=&quot;https://helenmagnani.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/uni6.gif&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Image Credits: https://helenmagnani.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was reading The Lost Symbol, by Dan Brown, there was an interesting idea shared which immediately awed me. It deals with the hypothetical question: “Do thoughts have mass?”. Though, on a weighing scale, thoughts may possess mass ranging in the nano to femto scale, if they do have a mass, there will be many implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of which was presented in the book was on gravity. If our thoughts had some mass, they will be bound by the laws of physics. Which meant, they will exert a gravitational force on other matter (though the force is of a very very small scale). Despite the insignificant amount force by a single thought, when a group of people come together to think on the same idea, this collective force becomes significant. It might then start to attract others towards this idea or notion. And that, will be powerful, when a thought can attract others and influence them to think in a certain way too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is a hypothetical question, the implications simply awed me. Upon further thinking: With thoughts having some mass, they will also be bounded by the Law of Conservation of Energy. Thoughts cannot be destroyed entirely. Instead, the thoughts are simply converted from one thought/idea to another. Or, they may become converted into another form of energy (likely chemical energy) in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is fascinating to imagine the implications if such a hypothesis was proven to be real. Whether it is true if thoughts have mass or not, only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of my favourite quotes on the power of thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Change your thoughts and you change your world. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Norman Vincent Peale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swami Vivekananda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Graham Bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wade Boggs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NUS Gradeless First Semester</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;NUS has introduced gradeless first semester since AY2014/15. And I am from AY14/15 batch. Though gradeless semester seems enticing, there’s really more to it. There are some conditions and pointers to take note which will leave you confused if you’re not used to the NUS system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to know: NUS utilises the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) to determine the performance of a student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formula for determining CAP: &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-126&quot; src=&quot;https://harishv7.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/screen-shot-2014-12-24-at-1-29-19-pm.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2014-12-24 at 1.29.19 pm&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the numerator is the sum of the product of module credits and grade points and the denominator is the sum of the module credits for ALL the modules taken so far. It’s crucial to note the cumulative function of the CAP. Hence, it is not determined on a per semester basis, but rather for the 3-4 years of modules taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximise the S/U options given during the gradeless semester, there are some things to note first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the class of degree you&#39;re aiming for.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degrees awarded are classified as shown (taken from NUS website):
&lt;table border=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honours Degree Classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Highest Distinction)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CAP 4.50 and above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Distinction)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.0 to 4.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours (Merit)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.5 to 3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Honours&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.0 to 3.49&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pass&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.0 to 2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Below 2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Note the Grade Point table:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letter Grades:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;A-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;B-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;C+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D+&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the target is Honours (Highest Distinction), then a CAP of 4.50 and above is required by the end of your 3-4 years. To achieve this, the average grade for the modules you took for 4 years must be at least an A-.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, during the S/U option, S/U anything below A- is a good option, since it will increase the number of modules with grades A- and above&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first semester is a good indication of the performance for the rest of the semesters, then S/Uing any modules with a gradepoint below your CAP is a good idea. For example, your CAP is 4.44, and your grades are A,A-, A,B+,B+, then S/U modules below 4.44 which are the 2 B+.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gradepoints allocated to the grades, for example 4.0 for a B+ means it will pull your overall CAP towards the 4.0. Hence, unless the overall CAP is below 4.0, then B+ would not really help with pushing the CAP upwards.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic chord strumming for the song. Sing and strum along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember to use a capo on the 1st fret of the guitar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chords Required (in sequence): 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
E(minor), G(major), D(major), A(minor)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strumming Pattern:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
D D U (change chord now) D D U (change) ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat the above for the entire song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s that simple! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to video if unsure: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOa_qKfyPV4&quot;&gt;Link to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NUS First Year | First Semester in Review</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s has been a great semester. Well, it was stressful, but it was particularly fulfilling. University life is exciting as I get to learn what I am most passionate about. The gradeless semester is another point that allowed me to read the modules without worrying too much about grades. Nevertheless, I was never aiming to SU any modules. Here is a quick review of the modules I took in Semester 1. All of them are pre-allocated since I am a Computer Engineering student, except the GEM I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CG1001: Introduction to Computer Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this module sums it up all. This module is meant to provide an overview of Computer Engineering for freshmen and allow them to have a clear understanding of what areas they can specialise in during their senior years. Basically, the workload is not much. &lt;br /&gt;
I was tasked with 2 reports (based on the specialisation areas in Computer Engineering) and a project video. The reports are 25% each and the video is 50%. Reports are done in pairs (randomly grouped by the professor). Similarly, for the project video, you will be assigned a group of four randomly. Then you have present a video (about 5 mins long) which presents the topic chosen in a creative and informative way. My group chose the topic on 4G LTE networks. We personally did it in the form of an advertisement and incorporated animation to make the video more interactive. This module is meant to help you pull up your CAP (though it is only 2 MCs). Give it your best, especially for the reports. Be creative and analytical when discussing the selected topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade I obtained: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Very much delighted to have obtained an A. I had really given my best for the reports and the video (especially the animation and planning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1010: Programming Methodolody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my most favourite module of this semester. I have no experience programming in C language. However, I was familiar with other languages like Python, Javascript and HTML. I personally like programming very much. The natural interest motivated me to do my best for this module. However, do not worry if you have no previous programming experience. Make sure you start learning the basics well, and do one practice task per day (there’s plenty of tasks on the CS1010 website). My lecturer was Mr Gary Tan. He is one amazing lecturer. He makes learning enjoyable and he is really funny. I am really happy to learn under him. He offered us a lot of help (separate group discussions and marking my past-year CS1010 papers I did for practice). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lectures are taught in a flipped-classroom method. You are expected to revise the slides and notes before the lectures (held in computer labs). This is very important indeed. Despite the long lecture, it’s not enough to cover all the concepts thoroughly. It requires many hours of practise to get the programming concepts and fluency expected of you. The module grading is broken up into 2 practical exams (10%, 25%), 1 mid-term test (15%), take home lab assignments (5%), attendance (5%) and the final exam (40%). I did not do well for the 2 practical exams. The first one was especially bad. Though I had good practice, the exam stress itself and the pressure under time restrictions made me panic. As a result, I was not able to complete the 2 tasks on time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mistake was that I focused on code logic and clarity, thinking that these criteria were also awarded significant marks. However, only after the exam did I know that close to 60% will be awarded for the correct output. Hence, focus on obtaining the right output. Your code may be inefficient, but it is your output that is being considered. Therefore, note that you are being awarded the marks for your ability to complete the task. The take home lab assignments are quite challenging. Try your best to complete it during the weekends. Last-minute stress is never good. Consult your friends and lecturers if you do not know how to do them. Lastly, and most importantly, finish the task within the suggested time limit (comes in helpful for the practical exams). Attendance and the lab marks (5% each) are really a giveaway for this module. Utilise it well and don’t skip tutorials unless you have a valid MC. The final exam was quite easy for me, except for one question. I guess it helped me to make up for the practical exams which I did not do as expected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade for CS1010: &lt;strong&gt;A-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly very happy with A-. Being my favourite module, I had really wanted an A+. But the practical exams pulled my overall grade down. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CS1231: Discrete Structures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally did not like this module when I first started. But as it progressed, I began to appreciate this module. It provides a different view to common concepts. You learn to prove everything. For example, you learn to prove that an even number plus another even number is even. Such seemingly simple things which we just assume to be true must be proven. One of the coolest things you’ll learn is to prove that 1+1 = 2. Well, if before this module, someone asked me to prove that I would have been stunned. But now, I do have an answer that proves this to be true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecturers for the module were Prof Stephen Bressan and Prof Bryan Low. Both of them were good. Prof Stephen likes to ask interesting questions on the topic and invites your opinions and answers. But he does cover the chapters very quickly (especially the proofs). Prof Bryan Low was good too. He actually goes through every proof that is in his notes and makes sure that you understand it clearly. Both lecturers are really approachable. Make sure to clear your doubts immediately after the lecture (before you forget them). That being said, this module is really demanding as the pace of the lectures is extremely fast. The tutorials are really crucial for you to grasp the application of the concepts learnt during lectures to the questions in your tutorials. Personal advice: Do NOT skip the tutorials. The recommended textbook is Discrete Mathematics Demystified. I found it barely enough to understand all the concepts taught. Nevertheless, it helped me greatly to comprehend the basic concepts in each chapter. For challenging exercises, see past year questions or ask your tutor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The module is graded based on a video project, a mid-term test and the final exam. As for the video project, my team focused on exploring the game of Tic Tac Toe. The video has been embed here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mo1_F806J_I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video project is meant to help you to pull your grade up. Do give your best in terms of analysing and presenting the chosen topic. The mid-term test was quite easy and the final exam was moderately difficult. Some questions only required common sense, while others really tested the concepts and formulas you’ve been taught. All in all, a content-heavy module that can be done well with consistent practise and dedication to learning the concepts well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really happy with the grade as I did not expect it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GEM2027: Public Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to choose to do a SS/GEM/breadth module in the first semester. Public speaking was the only module that fitted my timetable and the skill itself seemed really useful. Plus a bonus was that there were no exams. Of course, instead of the final exam, you will be graded on some of the speeches and there will be a module quiz at the end as well as a video project to be delivered. Lecturer for the module is Ms Cardoza. She is a very good lecturer and I like her enthusiasm in each lecture. She is very approachable (both personally and on forums) and encouraged me to give my best in my speeches. The lectures basically introduces some tips and pointers for effective public speaking. Some are really common sense, but the thing is that many of us fail to follow them. We need to remember simple things like body language (eg: do not put your hands in your pockets) and tone which will be critiqued by your tutor. Such seemingly simple pointers will be reinforced again and again throughout the module. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graded speeches are Informative (15%), Persuasive (20%) and Responders-Critique (15%). The other 50% is for the quiz and video. While there was plenty of time given for each speech, personally it really took up loads of time to prepare a good speech. It wasn’t as easy as writing the speech alone. Firstly, the speech category is broad. Hence, you will naturally spend quite a bit of time thinking on which topic you should speak about. Second, the preparation requires hours of research and analysis to support your points (any claim you make must be supported to establish your credibility to the audience). Third, you need to make your speech interesting, add some funny elements etc. Fourth, you need to practise again and again to ensure good body language and fluency of your speech. Fifth, if visual aids like PowerPoint is being used, you need to create the slides and practise controlling the slides. As you see, you need many hours of preparation before each speech. I usually use up my whole weekend doing the above. It wasn’t helpful that all my modules had tight deadlines to meet. Of course, if you’re someone who can manage your time easily or have prior experience in public speaking, this comes easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor is that the marks awarded for the speeches largely depend on how strict is your tutor is. Well, my tutor did have very high expectations since he speaks frequently at events and has a lot of experience in public speaking. Naturally, he expected a much more. Hence, the grade you get depends very much on your tutor too! Nevertheless, give your best and you will get what you deserve. The video project was really fun! We were free to do any video to express the ideas we have learnt in the course. My group created a comic-book type of video that is presented in terms of a storyboard. I enjoyed the project. Since it is due near the last week of the semester, you will barely have time to meet up for the project. Another downside was that my team members were all from different years of study (all of them were in Year 4 and from different faculties/majors). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it was almost impossible to get a time-slot to meet and discuss. We had to do it right away after class. Surprisingly, our video got shortlisted as one of the top ten! But we did not win the top prize though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the video &lt;a title=&quot;Public Speaking - No Longer Clarkie&#39;s Kryptonite! &quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOZsQ18Ufhs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hOZsQ18Ufhs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Always take a topic you are well knowledgeable about and confident with.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to be clear of the structure of your entire speech before deciding on it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It may help to write out the entire speech and then do the Preparation Outline (PO). All you would need to do is to copy and paste the relevant sections from the speech into the PO (with some rephrases, of course).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to buy a clicker to control the PowerPoint slides when presenting, or ask your close friend to lend you one (like I did).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creativity is greatly rewarded in this module. Especially for your video project, presenting the learning points in a creative manner can help you achieve good marks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very satisfied with this grade. I expected an A-. Nevertheless, I am sure I have given my best for this module. Public speaking is a skill you have keep developing anyway. Overall, it was a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MA1505: Mathematics I&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many concepts you need to understand for this module. Whenever you have free time, learn to utilise it to revise the upcoming topics. Though the lectures are nicely-paced, the amount of concepts to grasp requires quite some time. The last few topics (line and surface integrals may be difficult to grasp). The module is graded with a mid-term test (20%) and the final exam (80%). My lecturer for this module was Prof Leung Pui Fai (Fred). He is a very good lecturer. He takes the time to explain concepts very patiently. He is also very approachable. Make sure to pay good attention during the lectures. If you find the pace slow or you missed the lecture then you can always use the webcast on IVLE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial topics revolve around the ‘A’ level content such as differentiation, integration, functions, vectors etc. Hence, you might not need much time to grasp these concepts. However, for other topics like line integrals and surface integrals, you must be able to visualise what the formula you are using actually means. Everything you do will involved 3D manipulation. So, you have to visualise in 3D as well. This is the hardest part. Initially, I was a little lax about practise since I was able to do all the tutorial questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-term test was an eye-opener. The questions really test your understanding and are tricky. Mid-term questions are tricky and requires good thinking and speed to complete on time. Make sure to practise all the past-year papers which are available at IVLE and NUS e-library. It is a tough module, but with consistent practise you can do well. The one A4 paper (2-sided) cheat sheet really helps! Make sure to prepare your cheat sheet well. Ensure it is comprehensive and note that they are strict with the term “2-sided A4 sheet”. Only use a single A4 white paper to write notes on both sides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade: &lt;strong&gt;B+&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have done better (especially in the MCQ mid-term test), but a B+ is not too bad I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a good semester. Despite the 3 video projects (video projects really take up a lot of time!), I learnt a lot through the term. I could have done better in MA1505 and CS1010, but it is all in the learning experience to not repeat your mistakes. Most importantly, I have learned to manage my time better and study for the love of learning. Not just for the grades. Looking forward to the next semester. Till then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Most Powerful Thing in the World</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what is the most powerful thing in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, its not money, not wealth, maybe love, but really I think its an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, an idea. Every single day, we see ideas that change and craft the world. From the phone in your hand to the computer you’re reading this blog on, every thing around us took root from the idea that came up in someone’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you think about it, an idea isn’t something tangible. Not any physical product you can touch and understand. Nevertheless, you can feel it. And if an idea is powerful enough, it can change the world for the better, or for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly felt galvanised watching Inception. Inception is basically about implanting someone else’s idea into a target’s subconscious, deep enough, that it changes their way of thinking. Well, an idea seems like a simple thing. But the potential and the potency of an idea goes beyond itself. It creates a chain reaction so complex that without that single idea in a person’s brain, the world might have been different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea right now, in your head is something so powerful. Make sure it is put to good use. To make a change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you really want something, all the Universe conspires in helping you achieve it. -The Alchemist, Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote I always remember. What you are, who you are is defined by your ideas, your actions. If you have a good idea, and truly believe in it, then give it your best shot. Make your ideas come alive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revolution 2020 - Love, Corruption, Ambition by Chetan Bhagat</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Revolution_2020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Revolution 2020&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rating: ★ ★ ★&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_2020&quot;&gt;Revolution 2020&lt;/a&gt; was a particularly interesting read from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetan_Bhagat&quot;&gt;Chetan Bhagat&lt;/a&gt;. In this novel, the timeline spans across 3 main periods, his childhood then on to his teenage years and finally his adulthood in Varanasi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts by introducing Chetan Bhagat as a Guest-of-Honor (GOH) to a commemorative event, where he gets introduced to Gopal the Director of the University GangaTech. One thing leads to another, and a reluctant Chetan Bhagat sits in for a drink at Gopal’s place. Gopal shows off his big house and his extravagant spending character. However, Gopal after drinking too much collapses. And in the hospital he begins his narration of his life.Gopal’s childhood days are one that an ordinary school student can relate to. Though from a poor family, he has friends Raghav and Aarti who can be considered decently rich. This period mainly focuses on how the friendship blossoms between the trio, while concentrating more on Gopal and Aarti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gopal’s teenage years exhibit his profound love for Aarti, mainly understood by his thoughts. However, when Gopal proposes, Aarti refuses to reciprocate his love for her, citing that she is not ready for a relationship yet. Meanwhile, Gopal flunks both his AIEEE and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology&quot;&gt;IIT&lt;/a&gt; JEE exams. This causes some upset since his good friend Raghav manages to become one of the top scorers in the district. After his father insists that he goes to Kota to join a tuition to mould him well for a 2nd time try in both the exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Kota, Gopal learns of a shocking relationship between Aarti and Raghav. Moreover, he also fails to get the required ranking to get into the University a 2nd time. Gopal’s father dies soon after, unable to take in his son’s failure again. After this part, Gopal is left to be an orphan. His relatives start pressurising him to sell his ancestral land under dispute for a meagre sum of money. Feeling lost, and unable to think of any solution to move forward in life, Gopal barely drags himself. While searching for a cheap private University, Gopal gets introduced to the MLA, Shukla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From then, it seems like a turning point in Gopal’s life. He comes under the protective showers of the MLA. Motivated by the money that a private University can reek in, the MLA promises to settle the land dispute and have Gopal to run the private University (named GangaTech) in which he will be a ‘trustee’. Raghav, on the other hand, takes a contrasting route by forsaking his Engineering seat to pursue journalism, which he claims to be his passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon, Raghav begins publishing the MLA’s wrongdoings which leads to strained ties between Raghav and Gopal after disputes. Meanwhile, Gopal and Aarti get to become closer. After some time and persuasion, it is shown that Aarti is in love with Gopal. MLA Shukla is soon forced to resign after his wrongdoings go viral in Raghav’s newspaper named ‘Revolution 2020’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But will Gopal eventually win over Aarti? Or will it remain as Raghav and Aarti?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the crust of the story. However, be ready for a rollercoaster ride as further twists and turns are revealed in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was a good read, it was certainly quite difficult to accept the climax. Once again, Chetan Bhagat has produced a finely written story, with extra spices, making it ready for the big screens.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aashiqui 2</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;My Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aashiqui_2&quot;&gt;Aashiqui 2&lt;/a&gt;. The remake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aashiqui&quot;&gt;old hit movie&lt;/a&gt;. And it was simply worth every minute. A visual pleasure and an auditory treat, this movie was an outstanding production and brought your emotions to live as well. Despite the characters being newcomers into the industry, their performance was simply outstanding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_Kapoor&quot;&gt;Shraddha Kapoor’s&lt;/a&gt; innocence and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditya_Roy_Kapur&quot;&gt;Aditya Roy Kapoor’s&lt;/a&gt; charm simply carries away the hearts of many. The chemistry between the characters was simply intense, pure and at times heart-wrenching. The actors have proved their caliber in this movie by giving their best. Expecting their next release soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-plot-summary&quot;&gt;A Plot Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul Jaykar, a successful musician and singer is introduced as the film begins with his performance. Despite his success, his weakness, alcohol addiction is shown to be limiting his career. The show ends with Rahul in a fight with Aryan, who throws a bottle at him near the end of his first song, Sunn Raha Hain Na. He leaves the show abruptly following this and drives to the local bar. He witnesses a young girl, Aarohi singing his own song in the bar. He is thoroughly impressed with the girl’s potential and believes that she will be the next superstar in singing. He follows her and promises her to transform her into a superstar and asks her never to sing in local bars again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting Rahul, Aarohi leaves her job at the bar and travels to Mumbai. She calls Rahul, just as he told her to when she reaches Mumbai. However, unfortunately, Rahul gets attacked by a group of thugs and is severely injured in the ensuing brawl. He is subsequently admitted to the hospital where he is under treatment for a month. In the time, Aarohi tries many times to reach Rahul. However, Rahul’s friend and manager, Vivek tells her that Rahul is on an overseas trip for a performance and neglects further calls from her. Aarohi gets despaired by these events and starts to believe that she was cheated. After 2 months of fruitless attempts to reach Rahul, Aarohi gets heart-broken and gives up. She goes back to working at the bar due her family’s financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rahul keeps asking Vivek about Aarohi, but Vivek lies to Rahul that he received no calls or whatsoever. Once Rahul recovers, he leaves determined to find Aarohi. He finds her in a bar and realizes that Vivek has been lying to him all these while. Rahul sacks Vivek and convinces Aarohi that he will help her and recounts his situation for the past 2 months. Aarohi decides to trust Rahul for one last time, and agrees to go with him. Soon Rahul gives vocal training for Aarohi and helps her to attain a music contract with his production company. Aarohi becomes a very successful singer and a sensation. While everything seems fine, rumors spread about Rahul and Aarohi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahul becomes distraught about this and gives in to his alcohol addiction. Aarohi who loves him, comforts him and moves in with Rahul despite her mother’s disapproval of her actions. Aarohi slowly helps Rahul to gain control over himself from his addiction. Rahul does fine and involves himself in other activities to keep him away from his addiction. However, an encounter with a journalist who accuses him of using Aarohi for his gains, causes him to turn back to his alcohol addiction for relief. He becomes violent and aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A saddened Aarohi soon decides that she will take a hiatus from her career to help Rahul. Rahul realises that he is the obstacle in Aarohi’s life and will eventually cause her downfall in her career. One morning, Rahul promises Aarohi that he is going to change himself and focus on diet and a gym regime and drives off following a good-bye with Aarohi. However, it seems that it was his last good-bye as he commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. A devastated Aarohi decides to give up on everything and begins to move out with her parents. Rahul’s friend Vivek meets her, and encourages her to pursue her music career for which Rahul sacrificed his life and assures that it was what Rahul truly wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarohi decides to continue her music career and is successful. The film ends with Aarohi signing an autograph for her fans as “Aarohi Rahul Jaykar”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A must-watch movie that brings back the emotions and liveliness of a true love story. Despite the sorrow, the movie is able to reach deep within the audience. The songs, both “Tum Hi Ho” and “Sunn Raha Hai” are both amazing and addictive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Immortals of Meluha by Amish Tripathi</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/The_Immortals_Of_Meluha.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Immortals of Meluha&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortals_of_Meluha&quot;&gt;The Immortals of Meluha&lt;/a&gt; is the first book of the Shiva Trilogy written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.authoramish.com/&quot;&gt;Amish Tripathi&lt;/a&gt;, which portrays a fictional story of the revolution led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva&quot;&gt;Lord Shiva&lt;/a&gt;. The author has done a great job in accurately incorporating the characters such as Nandi into the story which provides a sense of realism of reading an actual novel on Lord Shiva. In fact, many traditional customs and terms used, such the caste system, adds to the authenticity of the book. It was an enjoyable read, particularly due to the touches of ancient Indian traditions which we still can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has frequent references to the old 4-type caste system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book, it follows the character of Shiva, a Tibetan tribal leader through his destiny. Shiva’s best friend is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virbhadra&quot;&gt;Veerbhadra&lt;/a&gt;. Shiva is the so-called warrior that everyone in a city called Meluha awaits to save them from the troubles they face. For one, the much sacred &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River&quot;&gt;Saraswati river’s&lt;/a&gt; water flow is dwindling. Shiva moves to Meluha with his tribe, where he thinks his tribe will be able to enjoy a better life and a stop from the frequent battles between his tribe and another. The services rendered to their tribe at Meluha simply overwhelms all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first night of stay, everyone from Shiva’s tribe start to experience weird symptoms like profuse sweating and high fever. Soon, the Chief of Medicine, Ayurvati, begins the healing process for all the tribe members. However, unexpectedly, Shiva is completely lacks these symptoms that others are showing and in turn, shows that his throat has turned blue. Upon this shocking news, Ayurvati brings it to the attention of the King of Meluha, Daksha, who declares Shiva as the Neelkanth, the exact warrior’s arrival the city has awaited for decades and even centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout these, Shiva meets &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandi_%28bull%29&quot;&gt;Nandi&lt;/a&gt;, a Captain, who he becomes very close to. Shiva also meets Princess Sati (aka Parvati), with whom he is attracted to. Shiva realises that Meluhans are the Suryavanshis and their enemies are the Chandravanshis. He is told of the brutal attacks carried out by the Chandravanshis on the innocent people of Meluha, especially the Brahmins, whom refuse to fight back as they practise non-violence. Shiva is also constantly exposed to the scenes of threats, many of which, he strives to save Princess Sati. The violence angers Shiva, who decides to accept the destiny of being the Neelkanth and seeks to take revenge on the Chandravanshis to put a stop to the battles and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Shiva is also introduced to the sacred elixir of life, Somras, through which all Meluhans attain lifelong immunity to any diseases, keeping them alive for many years. Their aging stops when they take the exilir, hence, most Meluhans are very youthful. Shiva comes across Brahaspati, the Chief Scientist working at Mount Mandar. They form a close brother-like relationship. Shiva also meet Parvateshwar, the Chief of the Meluhan Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sati slowly begins to reciprocate Shiva’s love and soon they get married. This is after initial hesitations of Sati and the others due to Sati being a vikarma (describes people who are considered to be sinful due to the sins committed in their earlier life). The Vikarma law, considered to be unfair to all becomes abolished by Shiva who is considered above the King in Meluha. Soonafter, Brahaspati is killed in a brutal attack by the Nagas at Mount Mandar, committed by the Nagas who were believed to be affliated with the Chandravanshis. This angers Shiva badly, leading to the declaration of war against Chandravanshis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war occurs and the Suryavanshis eventually win the Chandravanshis through their smart techniques, collaboratively formed by Shiva and Parvateshwar, though outnumber more than a ratio of 1:10 to the Chandravanshis. The Chandravanshi King is captured and brought before Shiva. The king then leaves, profoundly shocked by the sight of Shiva and his blue throat. It is then revealed by the King’s daughter that, they too believed earnestly in the legend of the Neelkanth, who will be the saviours of Chandravanshis. Upon hearing this, Shiva is crestfallen and unable to fathom his own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a distressed state, he then visits the temple dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama&quot;&gt;Lord Ram&lt;/a&gt; in Ayodhya, where the Pandit (the priest) counsels him and advises him of the actions he chose and his destiny. The book ends with Shiva rushing to save Princess Sati, waiting outside the temple, from the Naga, who is hidden among the tress behind Sati.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Night at the Call Center by Chetan Bhagat</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/One_Night_%40_Call_Center.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One Night @ the Call Center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_@_the_Call_Center&quot;&gt;One Night @ the Call Center&lt;/a&gt; is a story penned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetan_Bhagat&quot;&gt;Chetan Bhagat&lt;/a&gt;. The story revolves around the characters working in a call center at night. The characters are Shyam, Priyanka, Esha, Vroom, Radhika, Military Uncle and Bakshi (the evil boss). The story is narrated from Shyam’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the character are facing problems in their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shyam was earlier attached to Priyanka, but now have broken up. Despite, having feelings for her, he is in a daze when he comes to know, she is getting engaged to a NRI named Ganesh Gupta, a high-flier who works in Microsoft. Apart from this, Shyam seems to have lost all his esteem and self-confidence through the nature of treatment he receives from others and constantly degrading remarks from his evil boss, Bakshi. Bakshi is portrayed as a selfish boss who takes full credit for other work, only concentrating on his own self-improvement but not the call center company (Connexions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priyanka is initially happy about her new engagement. However, she is unhappy about her parents’ haste in marrying her the coming month itself. She feels is not yet ready for marriage and mulls over this. Meanwhile, Shyam and Vroom, who are good friends, unveil that Ganesh hid his baldness from Priyanka by showing her some online photos of Ganesh. This further saddens Priyanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha is an attractive girl, whose dream is to become a model. However, to achieve this, she went to the limits of sleeping with the designer to get the contract. The designer however, cheats her by saying she is an inch shorter than expected, and compromises by offering money. Esha feels deep guilt and hatred over herself for her actions. She is unable to accept herself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vroom is a fun-loving guy who has many aspirations. However, he works in the call center, subduing to everyone else, just to earn enough money to keep up with his rich friends and their hobbies. In the midst of the night, Vroom gets to know that Bakshi has taken credit for all the 6 months of hard work, that he and Shyam has put in to develop a customer service website. This angers him greatly, but he is unable to avenge his anger due to fears of losing his job. Meanwhile, he overhears Esha pouring her guilt to her other friends. Vroom who loves Esha, feels sickened after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radhika is already married. She has great trust and love for her husband. She endures all the trouble her mother-in-law gives her and succumbs to the traditional roles that her mother-in-law expects her to do, even preparing the daily milk with crushed almonds for her in the morning when she is rushing for work. Though Radhika, does not complain about this, her mother-in-law is still unhappy and complains all the time to her husband. Later on, Radhika accidentally comes to know that her husband has cheated on her. This greatly shocks and hurts her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military Uncle broke up with his son’s family some years ago. When he tries to maintain contact with his grandson by sending some photos, he receives an email from his son, asking him to cut all contact with the family. Military Uncle gets deeply saddened by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of them have their troubles, something unusual makes them realise the importance and appreciation of the life they are living. Facing some systems error, all the agents are unable to take calls. Vroom decides that they go out to a bar to relieve their stress. While on the return journey, Vroom decides to take a shortcut to reach office quickly and the van ends up crashing into a construction site. The van is left dangling precariously on the edge of a some steel rods above a abyss. When all hope seems lost, they receive a phone call in the no-reception area. The call was from GOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story follows what happens after God speaks to them and saves them by giving them some tips to escape out of the situation. God makes them stay true to their heart and promise that they will do what they have to do to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting read, especially the parts after the call from God were particularly inspiring in one way or another. The characters were easy to relate to and thus made much of the reading very comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might be a litte draggy at parts. Nonetheless, a great read!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Need an Internship!</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every computer engineer who is passionate about what he does will want to create or inspire a change that makes a difference in this world. Many a times, these inspirations, to even start, does not come from just pure academics, but rather from the practical experiences we gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across the this post which shows the best places where we can develop ourselves and get the inspiration we have always been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed on Business Insider, the top tech internships are offered by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google
Qualcomm
Microsoft
Intel
Cisco
IBM
Amazon
Apparently, the interview difficulty in getting the internship increases as we climb the list. Well, at the same time the salary increases (ranges between $5k – 6k) too. So you get what you work for despite the stiff competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is not only the best tech giants that can provide good internships. A good internship is one where we can learn to the fullest, about the process of not only creating ideas, but implementing it into a practical solution that yields tangible and visible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place where we can get such an experience will definitely be the start-up sectors. Here is where true entrepreneurship flourishes. Here is where we can learn the nitty gritty details of kicking off from the ground, to flying the plane, and landing at the destination. And here is where, you learn to unveil the entrepreneur in you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aminariana.com/essays/ultimate-internship&quot;&gt;Related article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the unconventional path to do the greater good in the world. Where’s the fun when everyone wants to the conventional things in life. Risk-taking and courage are truly the qualities of the successful leaders we see today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small quote from Apple:

        <title>Favourite Quotes from The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;book&quot; src=&quot;http://theliterarylawyer.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-alchemist.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#book {
	width: 40%;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil; It’s what come out of their mouth that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What you still to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severly tested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m only interested in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maktub (“It’s written.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gamecraft 2014</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took part in Gamecraft 2014, organised by NUS Games Development Group (GDG). My first so-called “hackathon” experience. Glad to have worked with great teammates, Alvian, Chris &amp;amp; Tio. Learnt a lot from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the given 24 hours and under the theme of “Contact”, we had to design and build a working game! This was a tough task, since we had to ideate within a short span of time and build a working prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some of my teammates had prior experience with platforms such as Gamemaker and Unity which allowed us to have a clear vision of how exactly are we going to execute our gameplan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the link to final copy of the 2D game, titled “ConTag”, which also won us the 2nd Prize in Gamecraft 2014!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o2snaeg836jelzr/AAD-Lxa5URgMqDPM-J8G1cr9a?dl=0&quot;&gt;Download ConTag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
